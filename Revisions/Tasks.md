# To-Dos 

# Code and result notebook changes & addons:

- [x] litterfall split (wood-fraction)
- [x] Prepare longer spin-up to fill explaination gap
- [ ] Check again SoilGrids, add new SoilGrid data (partly done)
- [ ] check out EU JRC LUCAS data set for validating EU
- [ ] explore again color scheme for maps – remove all area with less than 5%(?) cropland
- [ ] Discuss @all again, which and how data should be use for validation



# Add to paper manuscript:

## method:
- [ ] adding an example on how lu transitions work and are calcuated.
- [ ] Add detail in method part on area shares (ask @benni again on understand)
- [ ] Add table kcr2luh mapping
- [ ] explain in more detail the residue allometric functions (add units)

## results
- [ ] rethink main figure - 4 panels all we need - what else to add here?
  - [ ] We want to add other maps (on time trends, total cropland??)
  - [ ] grey out area below 5% (?) cropland -> ask Feli how to overlay
- [ ] rethink/recreate no-climate scenario (const climate, improved management??) 


## discussion:
- [ ] additional comparison of natural vegetation with LPJmL results (LPJmL correlation plot)
  - [ ] what numeric indicator to return with the plots? R², corr, mean bias?
  - [ ] Regional specific codes???
  - [ ] do all 4 panels have to have the same extent?
  - [ ] which extent to use: all, 99.9%, logarithmic?
  - [ ] adding map for 2010 diffs

- [ ] Rank uncertainty 
- [x] change reporting of stock change factors to area weighed means
- [ ] explain change in reporting of stock change factors
- [ ] use pugh results on scf as comparison

## data repo
- [ ] add more README information to data repo.

# Rewrite in paer manuscript

## method:
- [ ] rewrite paragraph on litterfall parameterization discussion after splitting up wood fraction

## results:
- [ ] (maybe) swift comparison to results and discuss more
- [ ] Rewriting results explaination
- [ ] add more detail to the initialzation analysis
- [ ] rephrase statement on maps (this are not the first maps including this)

## discussion:

- [ ] Argue for data versus parameter uncertainty 
- [ ] reframe tillage impact (tillage does get stronger, but still isn’t substainaly) 
- [ ] add lack of data statement to no muncipal waste returning to soils
- [ ] discuss deadwood pool vs. split up of litterfall
- [ ] add more detail to Tier 1 explainations (about spatial resolution of Tier 1 factors).
- [ ] improve line 110
- [ ] rephrase validation (What is validation? What is comparison?)
- [ ] poor management on tropical soils (literature to back up this claim)
- [ ] have regional specific sequestration rates (not only gobal)
- [ ] Reframe discussion on 4per1000

## Overall:

- [ ] Change citation to chapter reference (carefully check, if this holds true for all references)
- [ ] change to Pg/Tg
- [ ] Clear language on senstivity/quantitaive statements
- [ ] revise script on naming (not call it steady-state method anymore)
- [ ] framing of the paper (integrated assessment modeling)
- [ ] @all need more references to existing literature.


# Questions to clarify:
- [ ] Is on the global scale breeding, really the most important driver of yield increase? Can IPCC not capture this trend?
- [ ] N and root density – how to counteract these?
- [ ] Whereas data error cancel out, parameter uncertainty might lead to systematic error → discuss again with Benni
- [ ] think again about tropical SOC losses – why the are as high as before? Why their natural status shoud be already infertile (to less C inputs or soil properties?) It there literature available?
- [ ] How to general strcuure the point by point reply to be more reabable. How much detail to be included.
