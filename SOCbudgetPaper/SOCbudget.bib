  abstract = {Soils play a key role in providing a range of ecosystem services. Quality-assessed soil information, with quantified uncertainty levels, is needed to address a range of global issues. Traditional mapping methods, which recognize that soil classes are ``important carriers of soil information'', were used to prepare an updated harmonized dataset of derived soil properties for the world at a nominal resolution of 30 by 30 arc sec (WISE30sec). The map unit composition was determined using an overlay of the Harmonized World Soil Database, with minor corrections, and the K\"oppen\textendash Geiger climate zones map as categorical co-variate. Property estimates for the respective component soil units were derived using taxonomy-based transfer rules that draw on a statistical analysis of some 21,000 soil profiles. Best estimates (mean {$\pm$} standard deviation) for twenty soil properties were calculated for seven depth intervals (up to 2 m depth or less when thinner): organic carbon content, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, pH(H2O), CECsoil, CECclay, effective CEC, total exchangeable bases (TEB), base saturation, aluminium saturation, calcium carbonate content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, particle size distribution (content of sand, silt and clay), proportion of coarse fragments (\&gt; 2 mm), bulk density, and available water capacity (- 33 to - 1500 kPa); also the dominant soil drainage class. Coefficients of variation tend to be large. WISE30sec may be used for applications at a broad scale (\&lt; 1:1 M) upon consideration of the underlying data lineage, generalizations, and the associated uncertainties. As an example, the database was used to calculate the global soil organic carbon (SOC) stock to 2 m depth. Some 30\% (607 {$\pm$} 87 Pg C) of this stock (2060 {$\pm$} 215 Pg C) is held in the Northern Circumpolar Region, which is considered most sensitive to climate change.},

  abstract = {The soil is important in sequestering atmospheric CO2 and in emitting trace gases (e.g. CO2, CH4 and N2O) that are radiatively active and enhance the `greenhouse' effect. Land use changes and predicted global warming, through their effects on net primary productivity, the plant community and soil conditions, may have important effects on the size of the organic matter pool in the soil and directly affect the atmospheric concentration of these trace gases. A discrepancy of approximately 350 \texttimes{} 1015 g (or Pg) of C in two recent estimates of soil carbon reserves worldwide is evaluated using the geo-referenced database developed for the World Inventory of Soil Emission Potentials (WISE) project.

Total soil carbon pools for the entire land area of the world, excluding carbon held in the litter layer and charcoal, amounts to 2157\textendash 2293 Pg of C in the upper 100 cm.

This model, HadGEM2-ES, allows us to assess the impacts of climate change, multiple interactions, and feedbacks as the model is run. This paper discusses the results of century-scale HadGEM2-ES simulations from an impacts perspective \textendash{} specifically, terrestrial ecosystems and water resources \textendash{} for four different scenarios following the representative concentration pathways (RCPs), used in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013, 2014). Over the 21st century, simulated changes in global and continental-scale terrestrial ecosystems due to climate change appear to be very similar in all 4 RCPs, even though the level of global warming by the end of the 21st century ranges from 2 \textdegree C in the lowest scenario to 5.5\textdegree{} in the highest. A warming climate generally favours broadleaf trees over needleleaf, needleleaf trees over shrubs, and shrubs over herbaceous vegetation, resulting in a poleward shift of temperate and boreal forests and woody tundra in all scenarios. Although climate related changes are slightly larger in scenarios of greater warming, the largest differences between scenarios arise at regional scales as a consequence of different patterns of anthropogenic land cover change. In the model, the scenario with the lowest global warming results in the most extensive decline in tropical forest cover due to a large expansion of agriculture. Under all four RCPs, fire potential could increase across extensive land areas, particularly tropical and sub-tropical latitudes. River outflows are simulated to increase with higher levels of CO\textsubscript{2} and global warming in all projections, with outflow increasing with mean temperature at the end of the 21st century at the global scale and in North America, Asia, and Africa. In South America, Europe, and Australia, the relationship with climate warming and CO\textsubscript{2} rise is less clear, probably as a result of land cover change exerting a dominant effect in those regions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Crop residues are a potential source of renewable feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production because of their high cellulose content and easy availability. Indiscriminate removal as biofuel may, however, have adverse impacts on soil, environment, and crop production. This article reviews available information on the impacts of crop residue removal on soil properties, crop yields, and soil erosion across a wide range of soils and ecosystems. It explicitly synthesizes data on the independent impacts of crop residue removal on soil and environment rather than on the interrelated tillage-crop-residue management impacts. Published literature shows that residue removal adversely impacts near-surface soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Unmulched soils are prone to particle detachment, surface sealing, crusting, and compaction. Residue removal reduces input of organic binding agents essential to formation and stability of aggregates. It also closes open-ended biochannels by raindrop impacts and reduces water infiltration, saturated/unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, and air permeability, and thereby increases runoff/soil erosion and transport of non-point source pollutants (e.g., sediment and chemicals). Residue removal accelerates evaporation, increases diurnal fluctuations in soil temperature, and reduces input of organic matter needed to improve the soils' ability to retain water. It reduces macro- (e.g., K, P, N, Ca, and Mg) and micronutrient (e.g., Fe, Mn, B, Zn, and S) pools in the soil by removing nutrient-rich residue materials and by inducing losses of soil organic matter (SOM)-enriched sediments in runoff. Residue removal drastically reduces earthworm population and microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) biomass. It adversely affects agronomic production by altering the dynamics of soil water and temperature regimes. The short-term ( {$<$} 10 yr) data show nevertheless that residue removal may not always degrade soil physical properties and decrease crop yields in the short term depending on the soil type, topography, and fluctuations in annual weather conditions. Sloping and erosion-prone soils are more rapidly and adversely affected by residue removal than those on flat terrains with heavy texture and poorly drained conditions. Sloping terrains are not only highly susceptible to water and wind erosion but also to tillage erosion. In these soils, therefore, a fraction of the total crop residue produced may be available for biofuel production and other expanded uses. Standard guidelines on when, where, and how much residues to remove need to be, however, established. Modeling rates of residue removal are presently based on the needs of soil cover to control erosion without consideration to maintaining SOM and nutrient pools, enhancing soil physical, chemical, and biological quality, and sustaining crop production. Threshold levels of residue removal must be assessed for principal soil types based on the needs to maintain or enhance soil productivity and improve environmental quality. For those soils in which some residues are removed, best management practices (e.g., cover crops, diverse crop rotations, and manure application) must be adopted to minimize adverse impacts of residue removal. Because indiscriminate harvesting of crop residues for biofuel may deteriorate soil properties, reduce crop yields, and degrade the environment, there exists an urgent research need for developing alternative sustainable renewable energy feedstocks (e.g., warm season grasses and short-rotation woody crops).},

  abstract = {Demand for animal protein for human consumption is rising globally at an unprecedented rate. Modern animal production practices are associated with regular use of antimicrobials, potentially increasing selection pressure on bacteria to become resistant. Despite the significant potential consequences for antimicrobial resistance, there has been no quantitative measurement of global antimicrobial consumption by livestock. We address this gap by using Bayesian statistical models combining maps of livestock densities, economic projections of demand for meat products, and current estimates of antimicrobial consumption in high-income countries to map antimicrobial use in food animals for 2010 and 2030. We estimate that the global average annual consumption of antimicrobials per kilogram of animal produced was 45 mg{$\cdot$}kg-1, 148 mg{$\cdot$}kg-1, and 172 mg{$\cdot$}kg-1 for cattle, chicken, and pigs, respectively. Starting from this baseline, we estimate that between 2010 and 2030, the global consumption of antimicrobials will increase by 67\%, from 63,151 {$\pm$} 1,560 tons to 105,596 {$\pm$} 3,605 tons. Up to a third of the increase in consumption in livestock between 2010 and 2030 is imputable to shifting production practices in middle-income countries where extensive farming systems will be replaced by large-scale intensive farming operations that routinely use antimicrobials in subtherapeutic doses. For Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the increase in antimicrobial consumption will be 99\%, up to seven times the projected population growth in this group of countries. Better understanding of the consequences of the uninhibited growth in veterinary antimicrobial consumption is needed to assess its potential effects on animal and human health.},

  abstract = {The current interest in characterizing, predicting and managing soil C dynamics has focused attention on making estimates of C inputs to soil more accurate and precise. Net primary productivity (NPP) provides the inputs of carbon (C) in ecosystems and determines the amount of photosynthetically fixed C that can potentially be sequestered in soil organic matter. We present a method for estimating NPP and annual C inputs to soil for some common Canadian agroecosystems, using a series of plant C allocation coefficients for each crop type across the country. The root-derived C in these coefficients was estimated by reviewing studies reporting information on plant shoot-to-root (S:R) ratios (n = 168). Mean S:R ratios for annual crops were highest for small-grain cereals (7.4), followed by corn (5.6) and soybeans (5.2), and lowest for forages (1.6). The review also showed considerable uncertainty (coefficient of variation for S:R ratios of {$\sim$}50\% for annual crops and {$\sim$}75\% for perennial forages) in estimating below-ground NPP (BNPP) in agroecosystems; uncertainty was similar to that for Canadian boreal forests. The BNPP (including extra-root C) was lower for annual crops ({$\sim$}20\% of NPP) than for perennial forages ({$\sim$}50\%). The latter was similar to estimates for relative below-ground C allocation in other Canadian natural ecosystems such as mixed grasslands and forests. The proposed method is easy to use, specific for particular crops, management practices, and driven by agronomic yields. It can be readily up-dated with new experimental results and measurements of parameters used to quantify the accumulation and distribution of photosynthetically fixed C in different types of crops.},

  abstract = {In order to better assess the role of agriculture within the global climate-vegetation system, we present a model of the managed planetary land surface, Lund\textendash Potsdam\textendash Jena managed Land (LPJmL), which simulates biophysical and biogeochemical processes as well as productivity and yield of the most important crops worldwide, using a concept of crop functional types (CFTs). Based on the LPJ-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJmL simulates the transient changes in carbon and water cycles due to land use, the specific phenology and seasonal CO2 fluxes of agricultural-dominated areas, and the production of crops and grazing land. It uses 13 CFTs (11 arable crops and two managed grass types), with specific parameterizations of phenology connected to leaf area development. Carbon is allocated daily towards four carbon pools, one being the yield-bearing storage organs. Management (irrigation, treatment of residues, intercropping) can be considered in order to capture their effect on productivity, on soil organic carbon and on carbon extracted from the ecosystem. For transient simulations for the 20th century, a global historical land use data set was developed, providing the annual cover fraction of the 13 CFTs, rain-fed and/or irrigated, within 0.5\textdegree{} grid cells for the period 1901\textendash 2000, using published data on land use, crop distributions and irrigated areas. Several key results are compared with observations. The simulated spatial distribution of sowing dates for temperate cereals is comparable with the reported crop calendars. The simulated seasonal canopy development agrees better with satellite observations when actual cropland distribution is taken into account. Simulated yields for temperate cereals and maize compare well with FAO statistics. Monthly carbon fluxes measured at three agricultural sites also compare well with simulations. Global simulations indicate a {$\sim$}24\% (respectively {$\sim$}10\%) reduction in global vegetation (respectively soil) carbon due to agriculture, and 6\textendash 9~Pg~C of yearly harvested biomass in the 1990s. In contrast to simulations of the potential natural vegetation showing the land biosphere to be an increasing carbon sink during the 20th century, LPJmL simulates a net carbon source until the 1970s (due to land use), and a small sink (mostly due to changing climate and CO2) after 1970. This is comparable with earlier LPJ simulations using a more simple land use scheme, and within the uncertainty range of estimates in the 1980s and 1990s. The fluxes attributed to land use change compare well with Houghton's estimates on the land use related fluxes until the 1970s, but then they begin to diverge, probably due to the different rates of deforestation considered. The simulated impacts of agriculture on the global water cycle for the 1990s are{$\sim$}5\% (respectively{$\sim$}20\%) reduction in transpiration (respectively interception), and{$\sim$}44\% increase in evaporation. Global runoff, which includes a simple irrigation scheme, is practically not affected.},

  abstract = {The vertical distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) in the profile may constitute an important factor for soil carbon cycling. However, the formation of the SOM profile is currently poorly understood due to equifinality, caused by the entanglement of several processes: input from roots, mixing due to bioturbation, and organic matter leaching. In this study we quantified the contribution of these three processes using Bayesian parameter estimation for the mechanistic SOM profile model SOMPROF. Based on organic carbon measurements, 13 parameters related to decomposition and transport of organic matter were estimated for two temperate forest soils: an Arenosol with a mor humus form (Loobos, the Netherlands), and a Cambisol with mull-type humus (Hainich, Germany). Furthermore, the use of the radioisotope 210Pbex as tracer for vertical SOM transport was studied. For Loobos, the calibration results demonstrate the importance of organic matter transport with the liquid phase for shaping the vertical SOM profile, while the effects of bioturbation are generally negligible. These results are in good agreement with expectations given in situ conditions. For Hainich, the calibration offered three distinct explanations for the observations (three modes in the posterior distribution). With the addition of 210Pbex data and prior knowledge, as well as additional information about in situ conditions, we were able to identify the most likely explanation, which indicated that root litter input is a dominant process for the SOM profile. For both sites the organic matter appears to comprise mainly adsorbed but potentially leachable material, pointing to the importance of organo-mineral interactions. Furthermore, organic matter in the mineral soil appears to be mainly derived from root litter, supporting previous studies that highlighted the importance of root input for soil carbon sequestration. The 210Pbex measurements added only slight additional constraint on the estimated parameters. However, with sufficient replicate measurements and possibly in combination with other tracers, this isotope may still hold value as tracer for SOM transport.},

Overall the dynamics of the analyzed GHGs differed significantly. While CO2 and N2O differed considerably between the treatments, CH4 fluxes remained stable. In contrast, in vitro CH4 oxidation showed a clear increase for all amendments over time. CO2 fluxes were mostly dependent on the amount of organic residue that was used, while N2O fluxes were affected more by soil moisture. Several combinations of amendments led to reductions of CO2, CH4, and/or N2O emissions compared to un-amended soil. Most optimal GHG balance was obtained by compost amendments, which resulted in a similar overall GHG balance as compared to the un-amended soil. However, compost is not very nutrient rich potentially leading to lower crop yield when applied as single fertilizer. Hence, the combination of compost with one of the more nutrient rich organic amendments (sewage sludge, digestate) provides a trade-off between maintaining crop yield and minimizing GHG emissions. Additionally, we could observe a strong increase in microbial communities involved in GHG consumption in all amendments, with the strongest increase associated with cover crop residue mixtures. Future research should focus on the interrelation of plants, soil, and microbes and their impact on the global warming potential in relation to applied organic amendments.},

  abstract = {Soil is a valuable natural resource that in the short - term is nonrenewable and is difficult to reclaim when degraded. The use of soils on a sustainable basis requires that their capability to withstand the demands upon them is not exceeded. Those people concerned with conservation should be aware of the vital importance of soil for maintaining food supplies for an increasing world population. Increasing demands place a greater strain upon the soil. If the demands become too great, the soil becomes degraded. As soil is the basis of all terrestrial ecosystems, a degraded soil means lower fertility, reduced biodiversity, and human poverty. To provide basic information on soil degradation worldwide, a survey of soil loss through erosion, physical deterioration, and chemical pollution was made. Digital databases are not available to hold information necessary to monitor and combat soil degrada tion at global and national scales. Soil degradation is recognized as a serious and widespread problem, so in September 1987 the International Soil Reference and Information Centre was commissioned to make a survey for a map at a scale of 1:10,000,000 entitled "Global Assessment of Human - Induced Soil Degradation" (GLASOD). Until it was published in 1990, there was no uniformly collected body of information on soil degradation worldwide. The GLASOD survey provides basic data on the world distribution and intensity of erosional, chemical, and physical types of degradation. The original purpose of GLASOD was to provide factual information, to replace sweeping statements about soil and land degradation, and to raise awareness of policy makers and governments for the continuing need for soil conservation. The GLASOD survey also enables comparisons to be drawn between degraded soils of different continents, and the methodology used can be a basis upon which plans for restoration of degraded lands can be based.},

Despite a relatively strong increase in litter stocks, the modified parameterization results in less elevated wildfire emissions because of a litter redistribution towards more humid regions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Agroforestry systems comprise trees and crops, or trees and pastures within the same field. Globally, they cover approximately 1 billion hectares of land and contribute to the livelihoods of over 900 million people. Agroforestry systems have the capacity to sequester large quantities of carbon (C) in both soil and biomass. However, these systems have not yet been fully considered in the approach to C accounting developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), largely due to the high diversity of agroforestry systems and scarcity of relevant data.   Our literature review identified a total of 122 scientific, peer-reviewed articles associated with biomass C storage (50) and with soil organic carbon (SOC) (122), containing of total of 542 observations (324 and 218, respectively). Based on a synthesis of the reported observations, we are presenting a set of Tier 1 coefficients for biomass C storage for each of the 8 main agroforestry systems identified, including alley cropping, fallows, hedgerows, multistrata, parklands, shaded perennial-crop, silvoarable and silvopastoral systems, disaggregated by climate and region. Using the same agroforestry classification, we are presenting a set of stock change factors (FLU) and SOC accumulation/loss rates for three main land use changes: cropland to agroforestry; forest to agroforestry; and grassland to agroforestry. Globally, the mean SOC stock change factors ({$\pm$} confidence intervals) were estimated to be 1.25 {$\pm$} 0.04, 0.89 {$\pm$} 0.07, and 1.19 {$\pm$} 0.10, for the three main land use changes, respectively. However, these average coefficients hide huge disparities across and within different climates, regions, and types of agroforestry systems, highlighting the necessity to adopt the more disaggregated coefficients provided herein. We encourage national governments to synthesize data from local field experiments to generate country-specific factors for more robust estimation of biomass and SOC storage.},

  abstract = {The response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change is among the largest uncertainties affecting future climate change projections. The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type. Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is nature13731-m6jpg10K3620 years (95 per cent confidence interval). On average, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75\textdegree{} north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semi-arid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models.},

The responses of (1) crop yield [over the whole duration of the period (yieldm) and at the end of the experiment (yieldf)], (2) soil organic carbon (OC), (3) size of microbial biomass, and (4) Olsen phosphorus (P) to OA and OA + IF compared with IF only (standard control) and no fertilisation (nil control) were investigated. The overall effect of OA alone on yield was significant when compared with the nil control, but not when compared with the standard control. Only when OA and IF were added to soils that met specific conditions (low initial fertility, sandy texture, near-neutral pH values, under tropical climate) they rendered a significantly greater yieldf than the corresponding standard controls. The continuous application of manure caused greater relative and absolute gains in soil OC than straw + IF but did not produce significant greater yields while causing a considerable increase in Olsen P over time. The use of OA and OA + IF increased the resilience of agronomic systems over that of IF alone, as inferred from the smaller coefficient of variation of crop yield over time. We conclude that while the use of OA along with IF provides some additional benefits on yields as compared with IF application alone (especially under the above-mentioned conditions), the selection of the OA type and application rate should be carefully considered in order to maximise the nutrient use efficiency and minimise any undesirable effects to the environment.},

Large uncertainties remain about controls on the variability in global MRT of soil organic carbon. We estimated global MRT of topsoil (0\textendash 20cm) organic carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and found that mean annual air temperature, annual precipitation, and topsoil nitrogen storage were responsible for the variability in MRT. An empirical climate and soil nitrogen-based (Clim\&SN) model could be used to explain the temporal and spatial variability in MRT across various ecosystems. Estimated MRT was lowest in the low-latitude zones, and increased toward high-latitude zones. Global MRT of topsoil organic carbon showed a significant declining tendency between 1960 and 2008, particularly in the high-latitude zone of the northern hemisphere. The largest absolute and relative changes (0.2\% per yr) in MRT of topsoil organic carbon from 1960 to 2008 occurred in high-latitude regions, consistent with large carbon stocks in, and greater degree of climate change being experienced by, these areas. Overall, global MRT anomalies (differences between MRT in each year and averaged value of MRT from 1960 to 2008) of terrestrial topsoil organic carbon were decreasing from 1960 to 2008. Global MRT anomalies decreased significantly (P{$<$}0.001) with the increase of global temperature anomalies, indicating that global warming resulted in faster turnover rates of topsoil organic carbon.},

Incubation results indicated the addition of urea as a N source to the manure product at a rate to reduce the C:N ratio to approximately 12:1 resulted in a large increase in apparent net mineralisation. Field experiment results showed that application to pasture of manure with a high C:N ratio (above 18:1) resulted in a period of net N immobilisation and pasture growth restriction although there was no difference in annual pasture growth or grass N uptake. Knowledge of the C:N ratio of a manure product may help guide farmers in determining the best time to apply manure to soil to both maximise pasture growth and minimise potential nutrient losses to the environment.},

It needs few inputs and those it needs are easily obtainable. It is an extension of the earlier model described by Jenkinson and Rayner (1977), and by Hart (1984). Needless to say, it has many ideas in common with other contemporary turnover models, notably CENTURY (Parton et al., 1988) and Van Veen and Paul's model (Van Veen and Paul, 1981).},

In the fitting process, the model was first run with an annual return of plant C that had been selected iteratively to give the carbon content of the soil at the start of each experiment. This was done for the soil and climate of each site. If the radiocarbon content of the soil organic matter was known, the inert organic carbon (IOM) content of the soil was also calculated for the start of the experiment. Using these carbon and radiocarbon contents as a starting point, the model was then run for each of the experimental treatments to be fitted, using iteratively selected values for the annual return of plant materials to the soil. The value used for each treatment was selected to optimise the fit between modelled and measured data over the whole experimental period: fitting was done by eye. Thus fitted, RothC-26.3 gave an acceptable approximation to the measurements for 14 of the treatments, bearing in mind the experimental errors in measuring soil organic carbon on a per hectare basis. With four of the treatments (Highfield Bare Fallow, Park Grass plot 13d, Ruzyn\v{e} farmyard manure plot and Tamworth rotation 5), the fit was less satisfactory.},

However, none of these benefits will be possible until changes in C stocks can be documented accurately and cost-effectively. This is particularly challenging when dealing with changes in soil organic C (SOC) stocks. Precise methods for measuring C in soil samples are well established, but spatial variability in the factors that determine SOC stocks makes it difficult to document change. Widespread interest in the benefits of SOC sequestration has brought this issue to the fore in the development of US and international climate policy. Here, we review the challenges to documenting changes in SOC stocks, how policy decisions influence offset documentation requirements, and the benefits and drawbacks of different sampling strategies and extrapolation methods.},

  abstract = {The majority of the Earth's terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 {$\pm$} 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 {$\pm$} 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 {$\pm$} 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12\textendash 17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon\textendash climate feedback that could accelerate climate change.},

Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for up-to-date soil organic carbon (OC) data for global environmental and climatic modelling. The aim of this study was to create a map of topsoil OC content at the European scale by applying digital soil mapping techniques to the first European harmonized geo-referenced topsoil (0\textendash 20 cm) database, which arises from the Land use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS). A map of the associated uncertainty was also produced to support careful use of the predicted OC contents. A generalized additive model (GAM) was fitted on 85\% of the dataset (R2 = 0.29), using OC content as dependent variable; a backward stepwise approach selected slope, land cover, temperature, net primary productivity, latitude and longitude as suitable covariates. The validation of the model (performed on 15\% of the data-set) gave an overall R2 of 0.27 and an R2 of 0.21 for mineral soils and 0.06 for organic soils. Organic C content in most organic soils was under-predicted, probably because of the imposed unimodal distribution of our model, whose mean is tilted towards the prevalent mineral soils. This was also confirmed by the poor prediction in Scandinavia (where organic soils are more frequent), which gave an R2 of 0.09, whilst the prediction performance (R2) in non-Scandinavian countries was 0.28. The map of predicted OC content had the smallest values in Mediterranean countries and in croplands across Europe, whereas largest OC contents were predicted in wetlands, woodlands and mountainous areas. The map of the predictions' standard error had large uncertainty in northern latitudes, wetlands, moors and heathlands, whereas small uncertainty was mostly found in croplands. The map produced gives the most updated general picture of topsoil OC content at the European Union scale.},

Despite its widely recognized importance for terrestrial C sequestration, to date, no Earth System Model (ESM) implements soil erosion effects on carbon cycling in sufficient detail. So far, available studies have mostly investigated the magnitude of erosional C transport and in-situ measurements of vertical C fluxes on the catchment or regional scale. Recognizing the need to adequately represent C erosion processes and controls in ESMs, we provide a comprehensive cross-disciplinary review on lateral C redistribution in the landscape and discuss the implications for biogeochemical cycling of carbon. We present current knowledge on the role of erosional C distribution in controlling the stabilization and release of C in soils, taking into consideration the important geomorphic, ecological, hydrologic, pedologic and micro-climatic processes and controls that affect soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, fluxes, and persistence in dynamic landscapes. Further, we provide an overview on latest experimental and modelling approaches that are being used to investigate the role of erosion in the carbon cycle. Finally, to advance our understanding of the role of soil redistribution in biogeochemical cycles of essential elements, we discuss the most promising topics for future research in this field.},

However, the magnitude, patterns and uncertainties of carbon stocks and the effect of land use on the stocks remain poorly quantified. Here we show, using state-of-the-art datasets, that vegetation currently stores around 450 petagrams of carbon. In the hypothetical absence of land use, potential vegetation would store around 916 petagrams of carbon, under current climate conditions. This difference highlights the massive effect of land use on biomass stocks. Deforestation and other land-cover changes are responsible for 53\textendash 58\% of the difference between current and potential biomass stocks. Land management effects (the biomass stock changes induced by land use within the same land cover) contribute 42\textendash 47\%, but have been underestimated in the literature. Therefore, avoiding deforestation is necessary but not sufficient for mitigation of climate change. Our results imply that trade-offs exist between conserving carbon stocks on managed land and raising the contribution of biomass to raw material and energy supply for the mitigation of climate change. Efforts to raise biomass stocks are currently verifiable only in temperate forests, where their potential is limited. By contrast, large uncertainties hinder verification in the tropical forest, where the largest potential is located, pointing to challenges for the upcoming stocktaking exercises under the Paris agreement.},

  abstract = {Changes in soil organic carbon stocks depend on the management regime and a variety of environmental factors including climatic conditions and soil properties. So far, the dynamics of soil organic carbon have not been explicitly represented in global economic land use optimization models. Here, we apply an approach to represent soil organic carbon dynamics explicitly in a global bottom-up recursive dynamic partial equilibrium model using carbon response functions simulated with a biophysical process-based model. We project soil organic carbon emissions from European cropland to decrease by 40\% from 64MtCO2 in 2010 to about 39MtCO2 in 2050 mainly due to saturation effect when soils converge toward their equilibrium after management, crop rotation, or land use change. Moreover, we estimate a soil organic carbon mitigation potential for European cropland between 9 and 38MtCO2 per year until 2050 for carbon prices between 10 and 100 USD/tCO2. The total European mitigation potential including co-benefits from the crop and livestock sector due to the carbon price is even higher with 60MtCO2 equivalents (eq) per year. Thus carbon sequestration in soils could compensate 7\% of total emissions from agriculture within the EU, 10\% when including co-benefits from the crop and livestock sector. However, as production is reallocated outside Europe with increasing carbon prices, emissions decrease in Europe but increase in the rest of the world (20MtCO2 eq). Preventing GHG emission leakage to the rest of the world would decrease the European soil organic carbon mitigation potential by around 9\% and the total European mitigation potential including co-benefits by 16\%. Nevertheless, the net global mitigation potential would still increase. We conclude that no significant contributions to emission reduction targets should be expected from the European cropland carbon sequestration options considered in this study.},

  abstract = {Several studies have shown the dynamic interaction between soil organic  carbon (SOC) sequestration rates, soil management decisions and SOC levels. Management practices such as reduced and no-tillage, improved residue management and crop rotations as well as the conversion of marginal cropland to native vegetation or conversion of cultivated land to permanent grassland offer the potential to increase SOC content. Even though dynamic interactions are widely acknowledged in literature, they have not been implemented in most existing land use decision models. A major obstacle is the high data and computing requirements for an explicit representation of alternative land use sequences since a model has to be able to track all different management decision paths. To our knowledge no study accounted so far for SOC dynamics explicitly in a global integrated land use model. To overcome these conceptual difficulties described above we apply an approach capable of accounting for SOC dynamics in GLOBIOM (Global Biosphere Management Model), a global recursive dynamic partial equilibrium bottom-up model integrating the agricultural, bioenergy and forestry sectors.  GLOBIOM represents all major land based sectors and therefore is able to account for direct and indirect effects of land use change as well as leakage effects (e.g. through trade) implicitly. Together with the detailed representation of technologies (e.g. tillage and fertilizer management systems), these characteristics make the model a highly valuable tool for assessing European SOC emissions and mitigation potential. Demand and international trade are represented in this version of the model at the level of 27 EU member states and 23 aggregated world regions outside Europe. Changes in the demand on the one side, and profitability of the different land based activities on the other side, are the major determinants of land use change in GLOBIOM. In this paper we estimate SOC emissions from cropland for the EU until 2050 explicitly considering SOC dynamics due to land use and land management in a global integrated land use model. Moreover, we calculate the EU SOC mitigation potential taking into account leakage effects outside Europe as well as related feed backs from other sectors. In sensitivity analysis, we disaggregate the SOC mitigation potential i.e. we quantify the impact of different management systems and crop rotations to identify most promising mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {To keep global warming possibly below 1.5 \textdegree C and mitigate adverse effects of climate change, agriculture, like all other sectors, will have to contribute to efforts in achieving net negative emissions by the end of the century. Cost-efficient distribution of mitigation across regions and economic sectors is typically calculated using a global uniform carbon price in climate stabilization scenarios. However, in reality such a carbon price would substantially affect food availability. Here, we assess the implications of climate change mitigation in the land use sector for agricultural production and food security using an integrated partial equilibrium modelling framework and explore ways of relaxing the competition between mitigation in agriculture and food availability. Using a scenario that limits global warming cost-efficiently across sectors to 1.5 \textdegree C, results indicate global food calorie losses ranging from 110\textendash 285 kcal per capita per day in 2050 depending on the applied demand elasticities. This could translate into a rise in undernourishment of 80\textendash 300 million people in 2050. Less ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in the land use sector reduces the associated food security impact significantly, however the 1.5 \textdegree C target would not be achieved without additional reductions outside the land use sector. Efficiency of GHG mitigation will also depend on the level of participation globally. Our results show that if non-Annex-I countries decide not to contribute to mitigation action while other parties pursue their mitigation efforts to reach the global climate target, food security impacts in these non-Annex-I countries will be higher than if they participate in a global agreement, as inefficient mitigation increases agricultural production costs and therefore food prices. Land-rich countries with a high proportion of emissions from land use change, such as Brazil, could reduce emissions with only a marginal effect on food availability. In contrast, agricultural mitigation in high population (density) countries, such as China and India, would lead to substantial food calorie loss without a major contribution to global GHG mitigation. Increasing soil carbon sequestration on agricultural land would allow reducing the implied calorie loss by 65\% when sticking to the initially estimated land use mitigation requirements, thereby limiting the impact on undernourishment to 20\textendash 75 million people, and storing significant amounts of carbon in soils.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere \textendash{} the ``global carbon budget'' \textendash{} is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (\emph{E}\textsubscript{FF}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use change (\emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (\emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN}) and terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (\emph{B}\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {$\pm$}1\emph{{$\sigma$}}. For the last decade available (2009\textendash 2018), \emph{E}\textsubscript{FF} was 9.5{$\pm$}0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} 1.5{$\pm$}0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} 4.9{$\pm$}0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (2.3{$\pm$}0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} 2.5{$\pm$}0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} 3.2{$\pm$}0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, with a budget imbalance \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of 0.4\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2018 alone, the growth in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FF} was about 2.1\&thinsp;\% and fossil emissions increased to 10.0{$\pm$}0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, reaching 10\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} for the first time in history, \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.5{$\pm$}0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, for total anthropogenic CO\textsubscript{2} emissions of 11.5{$\pm$}0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (42.5{$\pm$}3.3\&thinsp;GtCO\textsubscript{2}). Also for 2018, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.1{$\pm$}0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (2.4{$\pm$}0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} was 2.6{$\pm$}0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} was 3.5{$\pm$}0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, with a \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of 0.3\&thinsp;GtC. The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration reached 407.38{$\pm$}0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2018. For 2019, preliminary data for the first 6\textendash 10 months indicate a reduced growth in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FF} of +0.6\&thinsp;\% (range of -0.2\&thinsp;\% to 1.5\&thinsp;\%) based on national emissions projections for China, the USA, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. Overall, the mean and trend in the five components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959\textendash 2018, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO\textsubscript{2} fluxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO\textsubscript{2} flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the CO\textsubscript{2} variability by ocean models outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Qu\'er\'e et al., 2018a, b, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013).

  abstract = {The most recent IPCC assessment has shown an important role for negative emissions technologies (NETs) in limiting global warming to 2 \textdegree C cost-effectively. However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5\textendash 3.6 GtCO2 yr-1 for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5\textendash 5 GtCO2 yr-1 for BECCS, 0.5\textendash 2 GtCO2 yr-1 for biochar, 2\textendash 4 GtCO2 yr-1 for enhanced weathering, 0.5\textendash 5 GtCO2 yr-1 for DACCS, and up to 5 GtCO2 yr-1 for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 \textdegree C of global warming.},

They are accompanied by detailed metadata on the year, spatial resolution and source of the input census data. Two versions of each species distribution are produced. In the first version, livestock numbers are disaggregated within census polygons according to weights established by statistical models using high resolution spatial covariates (dasymetric weighting). In the second version, animal numbers are distributed homogeneously with equal densities within their census polygons (areal weighting) to provide spatial data layers free of any assumptions linking them to other spatial variables.},

  abstract = {The rapid transformation of the livestock sector in recent decades brought concerns on its impact on greenhouse gas emissions, disruptions to nitrogen and phosphorous cycles and on land use change, particularly deforestation for production of feed crops. Animal and human health are increasingly interlinked through emerging infectious diseases, zoonoses, and antimicrobial resistance. In many developing countries, the rapidity of change has also had social impacts with increased risk of marginalisation of smallholder farmers. However, both the impacts and benefits of livestock farming often differ between extensive (backyard farming mostly for home-consumption) and intensive, commercial production systems (larger herd or flock size, higher investments in inputs, a tendency towards market-orientation). A density of 10,000 chickens per km2 has different environmental, epidemiological and societal implications if these birds are raised by 1,000 individual households or in a single industrial unit. Here, we introduce a novel relationship that links the national proportion of extensively raised animals to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (in purchasing power parity). This relationship is modelled and used together with the global distribution of rural population to disaggregate existing 10 km resolution global maps of chicken and pig distributions into extensive and intensive systems. Our results highlight countries and regions where extensive and intensive chicken and pig production systems are most important. We discuss the sources of uncertainties, the modelling assumptions and ways in which this approach could be developed to forecast future trajectories of intensification.},

We evaluated the interactive effect of manure C and N from nine dairy manures during a 176 days aerobic incubation. All of the manures had appreciable NH4 content, and varied widely in fibrous C. The incubation was conducted using sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid, Typic Haplorthod) and silt loam (fine, illitic, non-acid, frigid, Aeric Epiaquepts) soils at 25 \textdegree C and 60\% water-filled pore space. There were clear differences in nitrate (NO3) accumulation over time, including manures that resulted in net nitrification and net immobilization. For both soils, the rate of nitrification at 7 and 56 days after application, and the amount of NO3 accumulated at the end of the incubation (176 days) were strongly correlated (r = -0.88) with C: NH4 and also to the ratio of neutral detergent fiber (NDF):NH4 (r = -0.90). The addition of manure C also resulted in significant net immobilization, compared to addition of mineral N fertilizer alone. These studies demonstrate that increased understanding of manure C and N interactions may lead to improved prediction of manure PAN.},

To address this, we identify and quantify ``natural climate solutions'' (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS\textemdash when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation\textemdash is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y-1 (95\% CI 20.3\textendash 37.4). This is {$\geq$}30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y-1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is {$\geq$}100 USD MgCO2e-1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a {$>$}66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 \textdegree C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2-1. Most NCS actions\textemdash if effectively implemented\textemdash also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates.

This paper reviews the literature for the influence of land use changes on soil C stocks and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data from 74 publications. The meta analysis indicates that soil C stocks decline after land use changes from pasture to plantation (-10\%), native forest to plantation (-13\%), native forest to crop (-42\%), and pasture to crop (-59\%). Soil C stocks increase after land use changes from native forest to pasture (+~8\%), crop to pasture (+~19\%), crop to plantation (+~18\%), and crop to secondary forest (+~53\%). Wherever one of the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil carbon and vice versa. As the quantity of available data is not large and the methodologies used are diverse, the conclusions drawn must be regarded as working hypotheses from which to design future targeted investigations that broaden the database. Within some land use changes there were, however, sufficient examples to explore the role of other factors contributing to the above conclusions. One outcome of the meta analysis, especially worthy of further investigation in the context of carbon sink strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation, is that broadleaf tree plantations placed onto prior native forest or pastures did not affect soil C stocks whereas pine plantations reduced soil C stocks by 12\textendash 15\%.},

Although numerous case studies have been conducted, there remains a lack of quantification of the consequences of such environmental and anthropogenic changes on the SOC sequestration across global agricultural systems. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of SOC changes under different fertilizer managements, namely unbalanced application of chemical fertilizers (UCF), balanced application of chemical fertilizers (CF), chemical fertilizers with straw application (CFS), and chemical fertilizers with manure application (CFM). We show that topsoil organic carbon (C) increased by 0.9 (0.7\textendash 1.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI)) g kg-1 (10.0\%, relative change, hereafter the same), 1.7 (1.2\textendash 2.3) g kg-1 (15.4\%), 2.0 (1.9\textendash 2.2) g kg-1 (19.5\%) and 3.5 (3.2\textendash 3.8) g kg-1 (36.2\%) under UCF, CF, CFS and CFM, respectively. The C sequestration durations were estimated as 28\textendash 73 years under CFS and 26\textendash 117 years under CFM but with high variability across climatic regions. At least 2.0 Mg ha-1 yr-1 C input is needed to maintain the SOC in \textasciitilde 85\% cases.

  abstract = {Accounting for carbon fluxes from land use and land cover change (LULCC) generally requires choosing from multiple options of how to attribute the fluxes to regions and to LULCC activities. Applying a newly developed and spatially explicit bookkeeping model BLUE (bookkeeping of land use emissions), we quantify LULCC fluxes and attribute them to land use activities and countries by a range of different accounting methods. We present results with respect to a Kyoto Protocol-like ``commitment'' accounting period, using land use emissions of 2008\textendash 2012 as an example scenario. We assess the effect of accounting methods that vary (1) the temporal evolution of carbon stocks, (2) the state of the carbon stocks at the beginning of the period, (3) the temporal attribution of carbon fluxes during the period, and (4) treatment of LULCC fluxes that occurred prior to the beginning of the period. We show that the methodological choices result in grossly different estimates of carbon fluxes for the different attribution definitions.},

  abstract = {This study provides estimates of the net GHG mitigation potential of a selected range of management practices in the world's native and cultivated grazing lands. The Century and Daycent models are used to calculate the changes in soil carbon stocks, soil N2O emissions, and forage removals by ruminants associated with these practices. GLEAM is used in combination with these models to establish grazing area boundaries and to parameterize links between forage consumption, animal production and animal GHG emissions. This study provides an alternative to the usual approach of extrapolating from a small number of field studies and by modeling the linkage between soil, forage and animals it sheds new light on the net mitigation potential of C sequestration practices in the world's grazing lands. Three different mitigation practices are assessed in this study, namely, improved grazing management, legume sowing and N fertilization. We estimate that optimization of grazing pressure could sequester 148 Tg CO2 yr-1. The soil C sequestration potential of 203 Tg CO2 yr-1 for legume sowing was higher than for improved grazing management, despite being applied over a much smaller total area. However, N2O emissions from legumes were estimated to offset 28\% of its global C sequestration benefits, in CO2 equivalent terms. Conversely, N2O emissions from N fertilization exceeded soil C sequestration, in all regions. Our estimated potential for increasing C stocks though in grazing lands is lower than earlier worldwide estimates (Smith et al., 2007; Lal, 2004), mainly due to the much smaller grazing land area over which we estimate mitigation practices to be effective. A big concern is the high risk of the practices, particularly legumes, increasing soil-based GHGs if applied outside of this relatively small effective area. More work is needed to develop indicators, based on biophysical and management characteristics of grazing lands, to identify amenable areas before these practices can be considered ready for large scale implementation. The additional ruminant GHG emissions associated with higher forage output are likely to substantially reduce the mitigation potential of these practices, but could contribute to more GHG-efficient livestock production.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods D random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression D as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10 -fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

For global spatial layers on soil parameters, the most recent and complete dataset is available as the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD). The HWSD represents a step forward towards a spatially more detailed and thematically more refined set of global soil data. During the evaluation of the data for generating estimates of global SOC stocks Version 1.1 of the HWSD revealed also some rough edges. Consequential are the values of bulk density attributed to soils high in organic carbon. In the evaluation the database was completed and suitable substitutions for bulk density for soil high in organic carbon were investigated. For the amended data the global SOC stock to 100cm soil depth is estimated at 1,417 Pg C, although this estimate very much dependent on the ancillary data used. The amended HWSD was compared to data from 4 other global data sets on SOC stocks. The comparative evaluation has demonstrated that bulk density is the most important factor for estimating SOC stocks and mainly responsible for the differences between estimates. Most affected from the variability in bulk density are SOC stocks in areas with soils which are high in organic carbon.},

This net flux is the most uncertain term in the global carbon budget, not only because of uncertainties in rates of deforestation and forestation, but also because of uncertainties in the carbon density of the lands actually undergoing change. Furthermore, there are differences in approaches used to determine the flux that introduce variability into estimates in ways that are difficult to evaluate, and not all analyses consider the same types of management activities. Thirteen recent estimates of net carbon emissions from LULCC are summarized here. In addition to deforestation, all analyses considered changes in the area of agricultural lands (croplands and pastures). Some considered, also, forest management (wood harvest, shifting cultivation). None included emissions from the degradation of tropical peatlands. Means and standard deviations across the thirteen model estimates of annual emissions for the 1980s and 1990s, respectively, are 1.14 {$\pm$} 0.23 and 1.12 {$\pm$} 0.25 Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1} (1 Pg = 10\textsuperscript{15} g carbon). Four studies also considered the period 2000\textendash 2009, and the mean and standard deviations across these four for the three decades are 1.14 {$\pm$} 0.39, 1.17 {$\pm$} 0.32, and 1.10 {$\pm$} 0.11 Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1}. For the period 1990\textendash 2009 the mean global emissions from LULCC are 1.14 {$\pm$} 0.18 Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1}. The standard deviations across model means shown here are smaller than previous estimates of uncertainty as they do not account for the errors that result from data uncertainty and from an incomplete understanding of all the processes affecting the net flux of carbon from LULCC. Although these errors have not been systematically evaluated, based on partial analyses available in the literature and expert opinion, they are estimated to be on the order of {$\pm$} 0.5 Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Most of the emissions were from the tropics (102 {$\pm$} 5.8 Pg C), generally increasing over time to a maximum of 2.10 Pg C yr-1 in 1997. Outside the tropics emissions were roughly constant at 0.5 Pg C yr-1 until 1940, declined to zero around 1970, and then became negative.

In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community is developing the next generation of advanced Earth System Models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g. land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon-climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015\&ndash;2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, are required as input for these models. Here we present results from the Land-use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, with the goal to smoothly connect updated historical reconstructions of land-use with new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land-use patterns, underlying land-use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach builds off a similar effort from CMIP5, and is now provided at higher resolution (0.25\&thinsp;\&times;\&thinsp;0.25 degree), over a longer time domain (850\&ndash;2100, with extensions to 2300), with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated management practices), using more input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data), updated algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation), and is assessed via a new diagnostic package.

  abstract = {The lack of spatially detailed crop calendars is a significant source of uncertainty in modeling, monitoring, and forecasting crop production. In this paper, we present a rule-based model to estimate the sowing and harvesting windows of major crops over the global land area. The model considers field workability due to snow cover and heavy rainfall in addition to crop biological requirements for heat, chilling, and moisture. Using daily weather data for the period 1996\textendash 2005 as model input, we derive calendars for maize, rice, winter and spring wheat, and soybeans around the year 2000 with a spatial resolution of 0.5\textdegree{} in latitude and longitude. Separate calendars for rainfed and irrigated conditions and three representative varieties (short-, medium- and long-season varieties) are estimated. The daily probabilities of sowing and harvesting derived using the model well capture the major characteristics of reported calendars. Our modeling reveals that field workability is an important determinant of sowing and harvesting dates and that multicropping patterns influence the calendars of individual crops. The case studies show that the model is capable of capturing multicropping patterns such as triple rice cropping in Bangladesh, double rice cropping in the Philippines, winter wheat-maize rotations in France, and maize-winter wheat-soybean rotations in Brazil. The model outputs are particularly valuable for agricultural and hydrological applications in regions where existing crop calendars are sparse or unreliable.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Global agricultural production is heavily sustained by irrigation, but irrigation system efficiencies are often surprisingly low. However, our knowledge of irrigation efficiencies is mostly confined to rough indicative estimates for countries or regions that do not account for spatiotemporal heterogeneity due to climate and other biophysical dependencies. To allow for refined estimates of global agricultural water use, and of water saving and water productivity potentials constrained by biophysical processes and also non-trivial downstream effects, we incorporated a process-based representation of the three major irrigation systems (surface, sprinkler, and drip) into a bio- and agrosphere model, LPJmL. Based on this enhanced model we provide a gridded world map of irrigation efficiencies that are calculated in direct linkage to differences in system types, crop types, climatic and hydrologic conditions, and overall crop management. We find pronounced regional patterns in beneficial irrigation efficiency (a refined irrigation efficiency indicator accounting for crop-productive water consumption only), due to differences in these features, with the lowest values ({$<$} 30 \%) in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and the highest values ({$>$} 60 \%) in Europe and North America. We arrive at an estimate of global irrigation water withdrawal of 2469 km\textsuperscript{3} (2004\textendash 2009 average); irrigation water consumption is calculated to be 1257 km\textsuperscript{3}, of which 608 km\textsuperscript{3} are non-beneficially consumed, i.e., lost through evaporation, interception, and conveyance. Replacing surface systems by sprinkler or drip systems could, on average across the world's river basins, reduce the non-beneficial consumption at river basin level by 54 and 76 \%, respectively, while maintaining the current level of crop yields. Accordingly, crop water productivity would increase by 9 and 15 \%, respectively, and by much more in specific regions such as in the Indus basin. This study significantly advances the global quantification of irrigation systems while providing a framework for assessing potential future transitions in these systems. In this paper, presented opportunities associated with irrigation improvements are significant and suggest that they should be considered an important means on the way to sustainable food security.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Rapidly rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have prompted a flurry of studies on soils as potential carbon (C) `sinks'. Sequestering C in soils is often seen as a `win\textendash win' proposition; it not only removes excess CO2 from the air, but also improves soils by augmenting organic matter, an energy and nutrient source for biota. But organic matter is most useful, biologically, when it decays. So we face a dilemma: can we both conserve organic matter and profit from its decay? Or must we choose one or the other? In this essay, I contemplate the merits, first of building soil C and then of decaying (losing) it, partly from a historical perspective. I then consider the apparent trade-off between accrual and decay, and reflect on how the dilemma might be resolved or assuaged. These fledgling thoughts, offered mostly to stir more fruitful debate, include: finding ways to increase C inputs to soil; seeking to optimize the timing of decay; and understanding better, from an ecosystem perspective, the flows of C, rather than only the stocks. Carbon sequestration is a sound and worthy goal. But soil organic matter is far more than a potential tank for impounding excess CO2; it is a relentless flow of C atoms, through a myriad of streams\textemdash some fast, some slow\textemdash wending their way through the ecosystem, driving biotic processes along the way. Now, when we aim to regain some of the C lost, we may need new ways of thinking about soil C dynamics, and tuning them for the services expected of our ecosystems. This objective, perhaps demanding more biology along with other disciplines, is especially urgent when we contemplate the stresses soon to be imposed by coming global changes.},

This paper describes the methodology developed and the results obtained in a study aimed at estimating organic carbon contents (\%) in topsoils across Europe. The information presented in map form provides policy-makers with estimates of current topsoil organic carbon contents for developing strategies for soil protection at regional level. Such baseline data are also of importance in global change modelling and may be used to estimate regional differences in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and projected changes therein, as required for example under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, after having taken into account regional differences in bulk density. The study uses a novel approach combining a rule-based system with detailed thematic spatial data layers to arrive at a much-improved result over either method, using advanced methods for spatial data processing. The rule-based system is provided by the pedo-transfer rules, which were developed for use with the European Soil Database. The strong effects of vegetation and land use on SOC have been taken into account in the calculations, and the influence of temperature on organic carbon contents has been considered in the form of a heuristic function. Processing of all thematic data was performed on harmonized spatial data layers in raster format with a 1~km~\texttimes ~1~km grid spacing. This resolution is regarded as appropriate for planning effective soil protection measures at the European level. The approach is thought to be transferable to other regions of the world that are facing similar questions, provided adequate data are available for these regions. However, there will always be an element of uncertainty in estimating or determining the spatial distribution of organic carbon contents of soils.},

  abstract = {Cover crops have long been touted for their ability to reduce erosion, fix atmospheric nitrogen, reduce nitrogen leaching, and improve soil health. In recent decades, there has been resurgence in cover crop adoption that is synchronous with a heightened awareness of climate change. Climate change mitigation and adaptation may be additional, important ecosystem services provided by cover crops, but they lie outside of the traditional list of cover cropping benefits. Here, we review the potential for cover crops to mitigate climate change by tallying all of the positive and negative impacts of cover crops on the net global warming potential of agricultural fields. Then, we use lessons learned from two contrasting regions to evaluate how cover crops affect adaptive management for precipitation and temperature change. Three key outcomes from this synthesis are (1) Cover crop effects on greenhouse gas fluxes typically mitigate warming by similar to 100 to 150 g CO2 e/m(2)/year, which is higher than mitigation from transitioning to no-till. The most important terms in the budget are soil carbon sequestration and reduced fertilizer use after legume cover crops. (2) The surface albedo change due to cover cropping, calculated for the first time here using case study sites in central Spain and Pennsylvania, USA, may mitigate 12 to 46 g CO2 e/m(2)/year over a 100-year time horizon. And (3) Cover crop management can also enable climate change adaptation at these case study sites, especially through reduced vulnerability to erosion from extreme rain events, increased soil water management options during droughts or periods of soil saturation, and retention of nitrogen mineralized due to warming. Overall, we found very few tradeoffs between cover cropping and climate change mitigation and adaptation, suggesting that ecosystem services that are traditionally expected from cover cropping can be promoted synergistically with services related to climate change.},

  abstract = {The application of dynamic models to report changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, for example as part of greenhouse gas inventories, is becoming increasingly important. Most of these models rely on input data from harvest residues or decaying plant parts and also organic fertilizer, together referred to as soil carbon inputs (C). The soil C inputs from plants are derived from measured agricultural yields using allometric equations. Here we compared the results of five previously published equations. Our goal was to test whether the choice of method is critical for modelling soil C and if so, which of these equations is most suitable for Swiss conditions. For this purpose we used the five equations to calculate soil C inputs based on yield data from a Swiss long-term cropping experiment. Estimated annual soil C inputs from various crops were averaged from 28 years and four fertilizer treatments; the average was 3.6 Mg C ha(-1) and covered a surprisingly large range from 2.1 to 5.3 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) among the five equations. For single crop species, differences reached 6.6 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). The variation between estimated soil C inputs depended on crop type and increased with yield. Simulations with the model C-TOOL showed that calculated SOC stocks were affected strongly by the choice of the allometric equation. With four equations, a decrease in SOC stocks was simulated, whereas with one equation there was no change. This considerable uncertainty in modelled soil C is attributable solely to the allometric equation used to estimate the soil C input. We identify the evaluation and selection of allometric equations and associated coefficients as critical steps when setting up a model-based soil C inventory for agricultural systems. Highlights Uncertainty analyses in soil C modelling have focused mainly on model parameters and structures. The uncertainty related to estimation of soil C inputs from crop residues was calculated. Simulated soil C stocks and stock changes depend strongly on the method of estimating C input. The method to derive soil C inputs is critical for model-based soil C inventories.},

  abstract = {More diverse crop rotations have been promoted for their potential to remediate the range of ecosystem services compromised by biologically simplified grain-based agroecosystems, including increasing soil organic carbon (SOC). We hypothesized that functional diversity offers a more predictive means of characterizing the impact of crop rotations on SOC concentrations than species diversity per se. Furthermore, we hypothesized that functional diversity can either increase or decrease SOC depending on its associated carbon (C) input to soil. We compiled a database of 27 cropping system sites and 169 cropping systems, recorded the species and functional diversity of crop rotations, SOC concentrations (g C kg/soil), nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications (kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1), and estimated C input to soil (Mg C{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1). We categorized crop rotations into three broad categories: grain-only rotations, grain rotations with cover crops, and grain rotations with perennial crops. We divided the grain-only rotations into two sub-categories: cereal-only rotations and those that included both cereals and a legume grain. We compared changes in SOC and C input using mean effect sizes and 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Cover cropped and perennial cropped rotations, relative to grain-only rotations, increased C input by 42\% and 23\% and SOC concentrations by 6.3\% and 12.5\%, respectively. Within grain-only rotations, cereal + legume grain rotations decreased total C input (-16\%), root C input (-12\%), and SOC (-5.3\%) relative to cereal-only rotations. We found no effect of species diversity on SOC within grain-only rotations. N fertilizer rates mediated the effect of functional diversity on SOC within grain-only crop rotations: at low N fertilizer rates ({$\leq$}75 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1), the decrease in SOC with cereal + legume grain rotations was less than at high N fertilizer rates. Our results show that increasing the functional diversity of crop rotations is more likely to increase SOC concentrations if it is accompanied by an increase in C input. Functionally diverse perennial and cover cropped rotations increased both C input and SOC concentrations, potentially by exploiting niches in time that would otherwise be unproductive, that is, increasing the ``perenniality'' of crop rotations.},

Adjusting the HWSD's bulk density (BD) of soil high in organic carbon results in a mass of 1230 Pg, and additionally setting the BD of Histosols to 0.1 g cm(-3) (typical of peat soils), results in a mass of 1062 Pg.

We report the spatial distribution of SOC stocks per 0.5 arcminutes; the areal masses of SOC; and the quantiles of SOC stocks by continents, wetland types, and permafrost types. Depending on the definition of "wetland", wetland soils contain between 82 and 158 Pg SOC.

We estimated the certainty (likelihood) and quantity of increases and decreases on a half-degree grid. We assessed the effect of changes in controlling factors, including net primary productivity (NPP), litter quality, soil acidity, water saturation, depth of permafrost, land use, temperature, and aridity associated with probabilities (Bayesian network) on an embedded, temporally discrete, three-pool decomposition model. In principle, controlling factors were discretized into classes, where each class was associated with a probability and linked to an output variable. This creates a network of links that are ultimately linked to a set of equations for carbon (C) input and output to and from soil C pools. The probability-weighted results show that, globally, climate effects on NPP had the strongest impact on SOC stocks and the certainty of change after 75 years. Actual land use had the greatest effect locally because the assumed certainty of land use change per unit area was small. The probability-weighted contribution of climate to decomposition was greatest in the humid tropics because of greater absolute effects on decomposition fractions at higher temperatures. In contrast, climate effects on decomposition fractions were small in cold regions. Differences in decomposition rates between contemporary and future climate were greatest in arid subtropical regions because of projected strong increases in precipitation. Warming in boreal and arctic regions increased NPP, balancing or outweighing potential losses from thawing of permafrost. Across contrasting NPP scenarios, tropical mountain forests were identified as hotspots of future highly certain C losses. Global soil C mass will increase by 1 \% with a certainty of 75 \% if NPP increases due to carbon dioxide fertilization. At a certainty level of 75 \%, soil C mass will not change if CO2-induced increase of NPP is limited by nutrients.},

Plant litter is composed of complex mixtures of organic components, mainly polysaccharides and lignin, but also aliphatic biopolymers and tannins. The composition and relative abundance of these components vary widely among plant species and tissue type. Whereas some components, such as lignin, are exclusively found in plant residues, specific products are formed by microorganisms, e.g. amino sugars. A wide variety of chemical methods is available for characterizing the chemical composition of these materials, especially the chemolytic methods, which determine individual degradation products and solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, that gives an overview of the total organic chemical composition of the litter material. With the development of these techniques, an increasing number of studies are being carried out to investigate the changes during decay and the formation of humic substances. An overview is given on the amount of litter input, the proportion of various plant parts and their distribution (below-ground/above-ground), as well as the relative proportion of the different plant tissues. Major emphasis is on the organic chemical composition of the parent material for SOM formation and thus this paper provides information that will help to identify the changes occurring during biodegradation of plant litter in soils.},

  abstract = {The paper describes the model software REPRO (REPROduction of soil fertility) designed for analyzing interlinked carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes in the system soil\textendash plant\textendash animal\textendash environment. The model couples the balancing of C, N and energy fluxes with the target to estimate the climate-relevant CO2, CH4 and N2O sources and sinks of farming systems. For the determination of the net greenhouse effect, calculations of C sequestration in the soil, CO2 emissions from the use of fossil energy, CH4 emissions from livestock keeping and N2O emissions from the soil have been made. The results were converted into CO2 equivalents using its specific global warming potential (GWP). The model has been applied in the experimental farm Scheyern in southern Germany, which had been divided into an organic (org) and a conventional (con) farming system in 1992. Rather detailed series of long-term measuring data are available for the farm in Scheyern, which have been used for validating the software for its efficiency and applicability under very different management yet nearly equal site conditions.The organic farm is multi-structured with a legume-based crop rotation (N2 fixation: 83 kg ha-1 yr-1). The livestock density (LSU=Livestock Unit according to FAO) is 1.4 LSU ha-1. The farm is oriented on closed mass cycles; from the energetic point of view it represents a low-input system (energy input 4.5 GJ ha-1 yr-1). The conventional farm is a simple-structured cash crop system, based on mineral N (N input 145 kg ha-1 yr-1). Regarding the energy consumption, the system is run on high inputs (energy input 14.0 GJ ha-1 yr-1). The organic crop rotation reaches about 57\% (8.3 Mg ha-1 yr-1) of the DM yield, about 66\% (163 kg ha-1 yr-1) of the N removal and roughly 56\% (3741 kg ha-1 yr-1) of the C fixation of the conventional crop rotation. In the organic rotation, 18 GJ per GJ of fossil energy input are bound in the harvested biomass vis-\`a-vis 11.1 GJ in the conventional rotation. The strongest influence on the greenhouse effect is exerted by C sequestration and N2O emissions. In Scheyern, C sequestration has set in under organic management (+0.37 Mg ha-1 yr-1), while humus depletion has been recorded in the conventional system (-0.25 Mg ha-1 yr-1).Greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) due to fuel consumption and the use of machines are nearly on the same level in both crop rotations. However, the conventional system emits an additional 637 kg CO2 eq ha-1 yr-1, which had been consumed in the manufacture of mineral N and pesticides in the upstream industry.Besides the analyses in the experimental farm Scheyern, the model has been applied in 28 commercial farms (18 org and 10 con) with comparable soil and climate conditions in the surroundings of Scheyern (mean distance 60 km). The program calculations are aimed at benchmarking the results obtained in the farming systems Scheyern; they are expected to disclose management-specific variations in the emission of climate-relevant gases and to rate the suitability of the model for describing such management-specific effects. In order to make the situation in the farms comparable, only the emissions from cropping systems were analyzed. Livestock keeping remained unconsidered. Due to lower N and energy inputs, clearly lower N2O and CO2 emissions were obtained for the organic farms than for the conventional systems.The analyses have shown possibilities for the optimization of management and the mitigation of GGE. Our findings underline that organic farming includes a high potential for C sequestration and the reduction of GGEs. Currently, the model REPRO is tested by 90 farms in the Federal Republic of Germany with the aim to apply it in the future not only in the field of research but also in the management of commercial farms.},

  abstract = {The methods used for estimating below-ground carbon (C) translocation by plants, and the results obtained for different plant species are reviewed. Three tracer techniques using C isotopes to quantify root-derived C are discussed: pulse labeling, continuous labeling, and a method based on the difference in 13C natural abundance in C3 and C4 plants. It is shown, that only the tracer methods provided adequate results for the whole below-ground C translocation. This included roots, exudates and other organic substances, quickly decomposable by soil microorganisms, and CO2 produced by root respiration. Advantages due to coupling of two different tracer techniques are shown. \hspace{0.6em}The differences in the below-ground C translocation pattern between plant species (cereals, grasses, and trees) are discussed. Cereals (wheat and barley) transfer 20\%\textemdash 30\% of total assimilated C into the soil. Half of this amount is subsequently found in the roots and about one-third in CO2 evolved from the soil by root respiration and microbial utilization of rootborne organic substances. The remaining part of below-ground translocated C is incorporated into the soil microorganisms and soil organic matter. The portion of assimilated C allocated below the ground by cereals decreases during growth and by increasing N fertilization. Pasture plants translocated about 30\%\textemdash 50\% of assimilates below-ground, and their translocation patterns were similar to those of crop plants. On average, the total C amounts translocated into the soil by cereals and pasture plants are approximately the same (1500\hspace{0.25em}kg C ha\textemdash 1), when the same growth period is considered. However, during one vegetation period the cereals and grasses allocated beneath the ground about 1500 and 2200\hspace{0.25em}kg C ha\textemdash 1, respectively. Finally, a simple approach is suggested for a rough calculation of C input into the soil and for root-derived CO2 efflux from the soil.},

  abstract = {The observed and projected increase in emission of greenhouse gases, with attendant effects on global warming and sea level rise, have raised interests in identifying mitigation options. Terrestrial C sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Land use, vegetation and soil management have a strong impact on the biotic processes of C sequestration. Losses of C from the terrestrial ecosystems are exacerbated by deforestation, biomass burning, plowing, resource-based and subsistence agriculture, and practices that mine soil fertility and deplete the soil organic C (SOC) pool. Biomass burning may also produce charcoal, which is an inert carbon with long residence time. Practices that enhance C sequestration include afforestation and reforestation, conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and adopting systems with high biodiversity. Net C sequestration within an ecosystem can be assessed by taking into account the hidden C costs of fertilizers, pesticides, tillage, irrigation and other input. Restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems has a vast potential of C sequestration. The Kyoto Protocol provides for C sequestration in terrestrial sinks and C trading through Clean Development Mechanisms. Terrestrial C sequestration, besides being a win\textendash win strategy, offers a window of opportunity for the first few decades of the 21st century. It is a natural process of reducing the rates of gaseous emissions while alternatives to fossil fuel take effect.},

Soils of agroecosystems are depleted of their SOC stock and have a low use efficiency of inputs of agronomic yield. This review is a collation and synthesis of articles published in peer-reviewed journals. The rates of SOC sequestration are scaled up to the global level by linear extrapolation. Soil C sink capacity depends on depth, clay content and mineralogy, plant available water holding capacity, nutrient reserves, landscape position, and the antecedent SOC stock. Estimates of the historic depletion of SOC in world soils, 115\textendash 154 (average of 135) Pg C and equivalent to the technical potential or the maximum soil C sink capacity, need to be improved. A positive soil C budget is created by increasing the input of biomass-C to exceed the SOC losses by erosion and mineralization. The global hotspots of SOC sequestration, soils which are farther from C saturation, include eroded, degraded, desertified, and depleted soils. Ecosystems where SOC sequestration is feasible include 4,900 Mha of agricultural land including 332 Mha equipped for irrigation, 400 Mha of urban lands, and 2,000 Mha of degraded lands.

Important among these are decline in habitat of natural species and reduction in biodiversity, increase in risks of accelerated erosion and nonpoint source pollution, and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs; carbon dioxide [CO2], methane [CH4], and nitrous oxide [N2O]) from the terrestrial biosphere into the atmosphere with the attendant increase in the risks of global warming. Thus, a great challenge facing humanity lies in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (United Nations 2014) while restoring quality of natural resources (soil, water, and air) and saving land for nature conservancy. Therefore, the objective of this article is to discuss the conceptual basis of land-saving technologies for advancing food and nutritional security while improving the environment, adapting to and mitigating anthropogenic climate change, and enhancing biodiversity. This paper specifically focuses on one important dimension of the food security debate, and that is on the need to reduce (rather than expand) the use of land area, water, fertilizers, and pesticides, while achieving food and nutritional security and restoring the environment. The discussion provides hypothetical scenarios for increasing agricultural production while reducing the land area under agriculture along with\ldots},

About 60 to 70\% of the C thus depleted can be resequestered through adoption of recommended soil and crop management practices. These practices include conversion from plow till to no till, frequent use of winter cover crops in the rotation cycle, elimination of summer fallow, integrated nutrient management along with liberal use of biosolids and biological nitrogen fixation, precision farming to minimize losses and enhance fertilizer use efficiency, and use of improved varieties with ability to produce large root biomass with high content of lignin and suberin. The gross rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration ranges from 500 to 800 kg/ha/year in cold and humid regions and 100 to 300 kg/ha/year in dry and warm regions. The rate of SOC sequestration can be measured with procedures that are cost effective and credible at soil pedon level, landscape level, regional or national scale. In addition to SOC, there is also a large potential to sequester soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in arid and semi-arid regions. Soil C sequestration has numerous ancillary benefits. It is truly a win-win situation: extremely cost-effective, and a bridge to the future until alternative energy options take effect.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation. Land area globally affected by erosion is 1094 million ha (Mha) by water erosion, of which 751 Mha is severely affected, and 549 Mha by wind erosion, of which 296 Mha is severely affected. Whereas the effects of erosion on productivity and non-point source pollution are widely recognized, those on the C dynamics and attendant emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are not. Despite its global significance, erosion-induced carbon (C) emission into the atmosphere remains misunderstood and an unquantified component of the global carbon budget. Soil erosion is a four-stage process involving detachment, breakdown, transport/redistribution and deposition of sediments. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is influenced during all four stages. Being a selective process, erosion preferentially removes the light organic fraction of a low density of {$<$}1.8 Mg/m3. A combination of mineralization and C export by erosion causes a severe depletion of the SOC pool on eroded compared with uneroded or slightly eroded soils. In addition, the SOC redistributed over the landscape or deposited in depressional sites may be prone to mineralization because of breakdown of aggregates leading to exposure of hitherto encapsulated C to microbial processes among other reasons. Depending on the delivery ratio or the fraction of the sediment delivered to the river system, gross erosion by water may be 75 billion Mg, of which 15\textendash 20 billion Mg are transported by the rivers into the aquatic ecosystems and eventually into the ocean. The amount of total C displaced by erosion on the earth, assuming a delivery ratio of 10\% and SOC content of 2\textendash 3\%, may be 4.0\textendash 6.0 Pg/year. With 20\% emission due to mineralization of the displaced C, erosion-induced emission may be 0.8\textendash 1.2 Pg C/year on the earth. Thus, soil erosion has a strong impact on the global C cycle and this component must be considered while assessing the global C budget. Adoption of conservation-effective measures may reduce the risks of C emission and sequester C in soil and biota.},

  abstract = {The increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 by 31\% since 1750 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change necessitates identification of strategies for mitigating the threat of the attendant global warming. Since the industrial revolution, global emissions of carbon (C) are estimated at 270{$\pm$}30 Pg (Pg=petagram=1015 g=1 billion ton) due to fossil fuel combustion and 136{$\pm$}55 Pg due to land use change and soil cultivation. Emissions due to land use change include those by deforestation, biomass burning, conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems, drainage of wetlands and soil cultivation. Depletion of soil organic C (SOC) pool have contributed 78{$\pm$}12 Pg of C to the atmosphere. Some cultivated soils have lost one-half to two-thirds of the original SOC pool with a cumulative loss of 30\textendash 40 Mg C/ha (Mg=megagram=106 g=1 ton). The depletion of soil C is accentuated by soil degradation and exacerbated by land misuse and soil mismanagement. Thus, adoption of a restorative land use and recommended management practices (RMPs) on agricultural soils can reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 while having positive impacts on food security, agro-industries, water quality and the environment. A considerable part of the depleted SOC pool can be restored through conversion of marginal lands into restorative land uses, adoption of conservation tillage with cover crops and crop residue mulch, nutrient cycling including the use of compost and manure, and other systems of sustainable management of soil and water resources. Measured rates of soil C sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 50 to 1000 kg/ha/year. The global potential of SOC sequestration through these practices is 0.9{$\pm$}0.3 Pg C/year, which may offset one-fourth to one-third of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 estimated at 3.3 Pg C/year. The cumulative potential of soil C sequestration over 25\textendash 50 years is 30\textendash 60 Pg. The soil C sequestration is a truly win\textendash win strategy.

  abstract = {Accelerated erosion involves preferential removal of soil organic carbon (SOC) because it is concentrated in vicinity of the soil surface and has lower density than the mineral fraction. The SOC transported by water runoff is redistributed over the landscape and deposited in depressional sites where it is buried along with the sediments. However, the fate of the SOC transported, redistributed and deposited by erosional processes is a subject of intense debate. Sedimentologists argue that SOC buried with sediments is physically protected, and that depleted in the eroded soil is replaced through biomass production. Thus, they argue that the erosion\textendash sedimentation process leads to globally net SOC sequestration of 0.6\textendash 1.5GtC/year. In contrast, soil scientists argue that: (i) a large portion of the SOC transported by water runoff comprises labile fraction, (ii) breakdown of aggregation by raindrop impact and shearing force of runoff accentuates mineralization of the previously protected organic matter, and (iii) the SOC within the plow zone at the depositional sites may be subject to rapid mineralization, along with methanogenesis and denitrification under anaerobic environment. Whereas, tillage erosion may also cause burial of some SOC, increase in soil erosion and emission of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion are net sources of atmospheric CO2. Soil scientists argue that soil erosion may be a net source of atmospheric CO2 with emission of 1GtC/year. It is thus important to understand the fate of eroded SOC by measuring and monitoring SOC pool in eroded landscape as influenced by intensity and frequency of tillage operations and cropping systems.},

Demands on soil resources during the 21st century and beyond include: (i) increasing agronomic production to meet the food needs of additional 3.5 billion people that will reside in developing countries along with likely shift in food habits from plant-based to animal-based diet, (ii) producing ligno-cellulosic biomass through establishment of energy plantations on agriculturally surplus/marginal soils or other specifically identified lands, (iii) converting degraded/desertified soils to restorative land use for enhancing biodiversity and improving the environment, (iv) sequestering carbon in terrestrial (soil and trees) and aquatic ecosystems to off-set industrial emissions and stabilize the atmospheric abundance of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, (v) developing farming/cropping systems which improve water use efficiency and minimize risks of water pollution, contamination and eutrophication, and (vi) creating reserves for species preservation, recreation and enhancing aesthetic value of soil resources. Realization of these multifarious soil functions necessitate establishment of inter-disciplinary approach with close linkages between soil scientists and chemists, physicists, geologists, hydrologists, climatologists, biologists, system engineers (nano technologists), computer scientists and information technologists, economists, social scientists and molecular geneticists dealing with human, animal and microbial processes.

The principal objective of the chapter is to collate and synthesize available information on the soil C pool, historic loss of the soil C pool, the impact of land use and management practices that make the soil a source or sink for C, and the potential of world cropland soils to sequester C and mitigate the accelerated greenhouse effect. The strategy of soil C sequestration is a short-term, a partial solution to the potential risk of the accelerated greenhouse effect. Soil C sinks, as a major component of the net biome productivity, are important over short periods of time, but are not enough on a long-term basis to offset fossil-fuel emissions.},

  abstract = {Efforts to control climate change require the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This can only be achieved through a drastic reduction of global CO2 emissions. Yet fossil fuel emissions increased by 29\% between 2000 and 2008, in conjunction with increased contributions from emerging economies, from the production and international trade of goods and services, and from the use of coal as a fuel source. In contrast, emissions from land-use changes were nearly constant. Between 1959 and 2008, 43\% of each year's CO2 emissions remained in the atmosphere on average; the rest was absorbed by carbon sinks on land and in the oceans. In the past 50 years, the fraction of CO2 emissions that remains in the atmosphere each year has likely increased, from about 40\% to 45\%, and models suggest that this trend was caused by a decrease in the uptake of CO2 by the carbon sinks in response to climate change and variability. Changes in the CO2 sinks are highly uncertain, but they could have a significant influence on future atmospheric CO2 levels. It is therefore crucial to reduce the uncertainties.},

However, most models do not take full account of human land management and land use and land cover changes (LULCCs). We integrated croplands and pasture and their management and natural vegetation recovery and succession following cropland abandonment into the LPJ-GUESS DGVM. The revised model was applied to Africa as a case study to investigate the implications of accounting for land use on net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) and the skill of the model in describing agricultural production and reproducing trends and patterns in vegetation structure and function. The seasonality of modelled monthly fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) was shown to agree well with satellite-inferred normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). In regions with a large proportion of cropland, the managed land addition improved the FPAR vs. NDVI fit significantly. Modelled 1991\textendash 1995 average yields for the seven most important African crops, representing potential optimal yields limited only by climate forcings, were generally higher than reported FAO yields by a factor of 2\textendash 6, similar to previous yield gap estimates.

  abstract = {Straw return has been widely recommended as an environmentally friendly practice to manage carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural ecosystems. However, the overall trend and magnitude of changes in soil C in response to straw return remain uncertain. In this meta-analysis, we calculated the response ratios of soil organic C (SOC) concentrations, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission, nutrient contents and other important soil properties to straw addition in 176 published field studies. Our results indicated that straw return significantly increased SOC concentration by 12.8 {$\pm$} 0.4\% on average, with a 27.4 {$\pm$} 1.4\% to 56.6 {$\pm$} 1.8\% increase in soil active C fraction. CO2 emission increased in both upland (27.8 {$\pm$} 2.0\%) and paddy systems (51.0 {$\pm$} 2.0\%), while CH4 emission increased by 110.7 {$\pm$} 1.2\% only in rice paddies. N2O emission has declined by 15.2 {$\pm$} 1.1\% in paddy soils but increased by 8.3 {$\pm$} 2.5\% in upland soils. Responses of macro-aggregates and crop yield to straw return showed positively linear with increasing SOC concentration. Straw-C input rate and clay content significantly affected the response of SOC. A significant positive relationship was found between annual SOC sequestered and duration, suggesting that soil C saturation would occur after 12 years under straw return. Overall, straw return was an effective means to improve SOC accumulation, soil quality, and crop yield. Straw return-induced improvement of soil nutrient availability may favor crop growth, which can in turn increase ecosystem C input. Meanwhile, the analysis on net global warming potential (GWP) balance suggested that straw return increased C sink in upland soils but increased C source in paddy soils due to enhanced CH4 emission. Our meta-analysis suggested that future agro-ecosystem models and cropland management should differentiate the effects of straw return on ecosystem C budget in upland and paddy soils.},

The main routes for making the global agricultural system more productive are through intensification and technological change on currently used agricultural land, land expansion into currently non-agricultural areas, and international trade in agricultural commodities and processed goods. In order to analyse the trade-offs and synergies between these options, we present a global bio-economic modelling approach with a special focus on spatially explicit land and water constraints as well as technological change in agricultural production. For a global bioenergy demand scenario reaching 100 ExaJoule (EJ) until 2055 we derive a required rate of productivity increase on agricultural land between 1.2 and 1.4 percent per year under different land allocation options. A very high pressure for yield increase occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, even without additional bioenergy demand. Moreover, we analyse the implicit values (shadow prices) of limited water resources. The shadow prices for bioenergy are provided as a metric for assessing the trade-offs between different land allocation options and as a link between the agricultural and energy sector.},

In this context, a pan-European (EU + Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway) simulation platform with high spatial resolution and harmonized data sets was developed to provide consistent scenarios in support of possible carbon sequestration policies. Using the CENTURY agroecosystem model, six alternative management practices (AMP) scenarios were assessed as alternatives to the business as usual situation (BAU). These consisted of the conversion of arable land to grassland (and vice versa), straw incorporation, reduced tillage, straw incorporation combined with reduced tillage, ley cropping system and cover crops. The conversion into grassland showed the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates, ranging between 0.4 and 0.8 t C ha-1 yr-1, while the opposite extreme scenario (100\% of grassland conversion into arable) gave cumulated losses of up to 2 Gt of C by 2100. Among the other practices, ley cropping systems and cover crops gave better performances than straw incorporation and reduced tillage. The allocation of 12 to 28\% of the European arable land to different AMP combinations resulted in a potential SOC sequestration of 101\textendash 336 Mt CO2 eq. by 2020 and 549-2141 Mt CO2 eq. by 2100.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The effects of tillage on soil properties, crop productivity, and global greenhouse gas emissions have been discussed in the last decades. Global ecosystem models have limited capacity to simulate the various effects of tillage. With respect to the decomposition of soil organic matter, they either assume a constant increase due to tillage or they ignore the effects of tillage. Hence, they do not allow for analysing the effects of tillage and cannot evaluate, for example, reduced tillage or no tillage (referred to here as ``no-till'') practises as mitigation practices for climate change. In this paper, we describe the implementation of tillage-related practices in the global ecosystem model LPJmL. The extended model is evaluated against reported differences between tillage and no-till management on several soil properties. To this end, simulation results are compared with published meta-analyses on tillage effects. In general, the model is able to reproduce observed tillage effects on global, as well as regional, patterns of carbon and water fluxes. However, modelled N fluxes deviate from the literature values and need further study. The addition of the tillage module to LPJmL5 opens up opportunities to assess the impact of agricultural soil management practices under different scenarios with implications for agricultural productivity, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental indicators.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change activities play a critical role in Earth system dynamics through significant alterations to biogeophysical and biogeochemical properties at local to global scales. To quantify the magnitude of these impacts, climate models need consistent land-cover change time series at a global scale, based on land-use information from observations or dedicated land-use change models. However, a specific land-use change cannot be unambiguously mapped to a specific land-cover change. Here, nine translation rules are evaluated based on assumptions about the way land-use change could potentially impact land cover. Utilizing the Global Land-use Model 2 (GLM2), the model underlying the latest Land-Use Harmonization dataset (LUH2), the land-cover dynamics resulting from land-use change were simulated based on multiple alternative translation rules from 850 to 2015 globally. For each rule, the resulting forest cover, carbon density and carbon emissions were compared with independent estimates from remote sensing observations, U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization reports, and other studies. The translation rule previously suggested by the authors of the HYDE 3.2 dataset, that underlies LUH2, is consistent with the results of our examinations at global, country and grid scales. This rule recommends that for CMIP6 simulations, models should (1) completely clear vegetation in land-use changes from primary and secondary land (including both forested and non-forested) to cropland, urban land and managed pasture; (2) completely clear vegetation in land-use changes from primary forest and/or secondary forest to rangeland; (3) keep vegetation in land-use changes from primary non-forest and/or secondary non-forest to rangeland. Our analysis shows that this rule is one of three (out of nine) rules that produce comparable estimates of forest cover, vegetation carbon and emissions to independent estimates and also mitigate the anomalously high carbon emissions from land-use change observed in previous studies in the 1950s. According to the three translation rules, contemporary global forest area is estimated to be 37.42\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{6}\&thinsp;km\textsuperscript{2}, within the range derived from remote sensing products. Likewise, the estimated carbon stock is in close agreement with reference biomass datasets, particularly over regions with more than 50\&thinsp;\% forest cover.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of organic carbon mineralization is fundamental in forecasting biosphere to atmosphere net carbon ecosystem exchange (NEE). With this perspective, we developed 3D-CMCC-PSM, a new version of the hybrid process based model 3D-CMCC FEM where also heterotrophic respiration (Rh) is explicitly simulated. The aim was to quantify NEE as a forward problem, by subtracting ecosystem respiration (Reco) to gross primary productivity (GPP). To do so, we developed a simplification of the soil carbon dynamics routine proposed in the DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition) computer simulation model. The method calculates decomposition as a function of soil moisture, temperature, state of the organic compartments, and relative abundance of microbial pools. Given the pulse dynamics of soil respiration, we introduced modifications in some of the principal constitutive relations involved in phenology and littering sub-routines. We quantified the model structure-related uncertainty in NEE, by running our training simulations over 1000 random parameter-sets extracted from parameter distributions expected from literature. 3D-CMCC-PSM predictability was tested on independent time series for 6 Fluxnet sites. The model resulted in daily and monthly estimations highly consistent with the observed time series. It showed lower predictability in Mediterranean ecosystems, suggesting that it may need further improvements in addressing evapotranspiration and water dynamics.},

  abstract = {We review various recent approaches to making digital soil maps based on geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, note some commonalities and propose a generic framework for the future. We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their `environment'. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the `environment'. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny's five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps:  (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution {$\rho$} and block size {$\beta$}. (ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q. (iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers. (iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites. (v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data. (vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham's razor) with autocorrelated errors. (vii) Predict digital map. (viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing. (ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v). Finally, possible applications, problems and improvements are discussed.},

  abstract = {The `4 per mille Soils for Food Security and Climate' was launched at the COP21 with an aspiration to increase global soil organic matter stocks by 4 per 1000 (or 0.4 \%) per year as a compensation for the global emissions of greenhouse gases by anthropogenic sources. This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England \&amp; Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30 t C ha- 1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3 m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3 Gt C year- 1, which effectively offset 20\textendash 35\% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers.},

  abstract = {Crop models require information on both weather and agronomic decisions to simulate crop productivity and to design adaptation strategies. Due to the lack of observational data, previous studies used different approaches to determine sowing dates and cultivar parameters. However, the timing of harvest has not yet been sufficiently analyzed. Here we propose an algorithm to determine location-specific maturity (or harvest) dates for applications in global modelling studies. Given a sowing date and the climatic conditions, the algorithm returns a suitable maturity date, based on crop physiological parameters and agronomic principles. We test the method on a global land area with a spatial resolution of 0.5\textdegree{} against global reported datasets for major grain crops: winter-wheat, spring-wheat, rice, maize, sorghum and soybean. A single set of rules is able to largely reproduce the observed harvest dates of the six grain crops globally, with a mean absolute error of 19 (maize) to 45 (rice) days. In temperate regions, the temperature seasonality is the major driver of cropping calendars. In sub-tropical regions, crops are grown to match water availability. In the case of limiting growing seasons, the crop cycle is shortened or extended to avoid stressful periods. In the case of long-lasting favorable conditions the crop cycle is shorter than what the growing season would allow. We find that cropping periods can be largely defined by climate and crop physiological traits. The timing of the reproductive phase is shown to be a general criterion for selecting grain crops cultivars. This work will allow for dynamically representing adaptation to climate change by adjusting cultivars and represents a first step towards improved crop phenology simulations by global-scale crop models.},

  abstract = {With the Paris Agreement's ambition of limiting climate change to well below 2 degrees C, negative emission technologies (NETs) have moved into the limelight of discussions in climate science and policy. Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 degrees C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 degrees C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice.},

We supply a set of climate impact scenarios on agricultural land productivity derived from two climate models and two biophysical crop growth models to account for some of the uncertainty inherent in climate and impact models. Aggregation in space and time leads to information losses that can determine climate change impacts on agricultural markets and land-use patterns because often aggregation is across steep gradients from low to high impacts or from increases to decreases. The four climate change impact scenarios supplied here were designed to represent the most significant impacts (high emission scenario only, assumed ineffectiveness of carbon dioxide fertilization on agricultural yields, no adjustments in management) but are consistent with the assumption that changes in agricultural practices are covered in the economic models. Globally, production of individual crops decrease by 10\textendash 38\% under these climate change scenarios, with large uncertainties in spatial patterns that are determined by both the uncertainty in climate projections and the choice of impact model. This uncertainty in climate impact on crop productivity needs to be considered by economic assessments of climate change.},

  abstract = {We assess the literature on innovation and upscaling for negative emissions technologies (NETs) using a systematic and reproducible literature coding procedure. To structure our review, we employ the framework of sequential stages in the innovation process, with which we code each NETs article in innovation space. We find that while there is a growing body of innovation literature on NETs, 59\% of the articles are focused on the earliest stages of the innovation process, `research and development' (R\&D). The subsequent stages of innovation are also represented in the literature, but at much lower levels of activity than R\&D. Distinguishing between innovation stages that are related to the supply of the technology (R\&D, demonstrations, scale up) and demand for the technology (demand pull, niche markets, public acceptance), we find an overwhelming emphasis (83\%) on the supply side. BECCS articles have an above average share of demand-side articles while direct air carbon capture and storage has a very low share. Innovation in NETs has much to learn from successfully diffused technologies; appealing to heterogeneous users, managing policy risk, as well as understanding and addressing public concerns are all crucial yet not well represented in the extant literature. Results from integrated assessment models show that while NETs play a key role in the second half of the 21st century for 1.5 \textdegree C and 2 \textdegree C scenarios, the major period of new NETs deployment is between 2030 and 2050. Given that the broader innovation literature consistently finds long time periods involved in scaling up and deploying novel technologies, there is an urgency to developing NETs that is largely unappreciated. This challenge is exacerbated by the thousands to millions of actors that potentially need to adopt these technologies for them to achieve planetary scale. This urgency is reflected neither in the Paris Agreement nor in most of the literature we review here. If NETs are to be deployed at the levels required to meet 1.5 \textdegree C and 2 \textdegree C targets, then important post-R\&D issues will need to be addressed in the literature, including incentives for early deployment, niche markets, scale-up, demand, and\textemdash particularly if deployment is to be hastened\textemdash public acceptance.},

  abstract = {.We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the impact of changing agricultural land use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage under moist and dry climatic conditions of temperate and tropical regions. We derived estimates of management impacts for a carbon accounting approach developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, addressing the impact of long-term cultivation, setting-aside land from crop production, changing tillage management, and modifying C input to the soil by varying cropping practices. We found 126 articles that met our criteria and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. In general, management impacts were sensitive to climate in the following order from largest to smallest changes in SOC: tropical moist{$>$}tropical dry{$>$}temperate moist{$>$}temperate dry. For example, long-term cultivation caused the greatest loss of SOC in tropical moist climates, with cultivated soils having 0.58 {$\pm$} 0.12, or 58\% of the amount found under native vegetation, followed by tropical dry climates with 0.69 {$\pm$} 0.13, temperate moist with 0.71 {$\pm$} 0.04, and temperate dry with 0.82 {$\pm$} 0.04. Similarly, converting from conventional tillage to no-till increased SOC storage over 20 years by a factor of 1.23 {$\pm$} 0.05 in tropical moist climates, which is a 23\% increase in SOC, while the corresponding change in tropical dry climates was 1.17 {$\pm$} 0.05, temperate moist was 1.16 {$\pm$} 0.02, and temperate dry was 1.10 {$\pm$} 0.03. These results demonstrate that agricultural management impacts on SOC storage will vary depending on climatic conditions that influence the plant and soil processes driving soil organic matter dynamics.},

  abstract = {Process-based model analyses are often used to estimate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), particularly at regional to continental scales. However, uncertainties are rarely evaluated, and so it is difficult to determine how much confidence can be placed in the results. Our objective was to quantify uncertainties across multiple scales in a process-based model analysis, and provide 95\% confidence intervals for the estimates. Specifically, we used the Century ecosystem model to estimate changes in SOC stocks for US croplands during the 1990s, addressing uncertainties in model inputs, structure and scaling of results from point locations to regions and the entire country. Overall, SOC stocks increased in US croplands by 14.6~Tg~C~yr-1 from 1990 to 1995 and 17.5~Tg~C~yr-1 during 1995 to 2000, and uncertainties were {$\pm$}22\% and {$\pm$}16\% for the two time periods, respectively. Uncertainties were inversely related to spatial scale, with median uncertainties at the regional scale estimated at {$\pm$}118\% and {$\pm$}114\% during the early and latter part of 1990s, and even higher at the site scale with estimates at {$\pm$}739\% and {$\pm$}674\% for the time periods, respectively. This relationship appeared to be driven by the amount of the SOC stock change; changes in stocks that exceeded 200~Gg~C~yr-1 represented a threshold where uncertainties were always lower than {$\pm$}100\%. Consequently, the amount of uncertainty in estimates derived from process-based models will partly depend on the level of SOC accumulation or loss. In general, the majority of uncertainty was associated with model structure in this application, and so attaining higher levels of precision in the estimates will largely depend on improving the model algorithms and parameterization, as well as increasing the number of measurement sites used to evaluate the structural uncertainty.},

On large (regional to global)-scale levels, assessment of how these different services will vary in space and time, especially in response to cropland management, are scarce. We explore cropland management alternatives and the effect these can have on future C and N pools and fluxes using the land-use-enabled dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS (Lund\textendash Potsdam\textendash Jena General Ecosystem Simulator). Simulated crop production, cropland carbon storage, carbon sequestration and nitrogen leaching from croplands are evaluated and discussed.

Our results show that the potential for carbon sequestration due to typical cropland management practices such as no-till management and cover crops proposed in previous studies is not realised, globally or over larger climatic regions.

  abstract = {Increasing pressures on ecosystems through global climate and other land-use changes require predictive models of their consequences for vital processes such as soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. These environmental changes will undoubtedly affect soil fauna. There is sufficient evidence that soil fauna have significant effects on all of the pools and fluxes in these cycles, and soil fauna mineralize more N than microbes in some habitats. It is therefore essential that their role in the C and N cycle be understood. Here we introduce a new framework that attempts to reconcile our current understanding of the role of soil fauna within the C and N cycle with biogeochemical models and soil food web models. Using a simple stoichiometric approach to integrate our understanding of N mineralization and immobilization with the C:N ratio of substrates and faunal life history characteristics, as used in food web studies, we consider two mechanisms through which soil fauna can directly affect N cycling. First, fauna that are efficient assimilators of C and that have prey with similar C:N ratios as themselves, are likely to contribute directly to the mineral N pool. Second, fauna that are inefficient assimilators of C and that have prey with higher C:N ratios than themselves are likely to contribute most to the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool. Different groups of fauna are likely to contribute to these two pathways. Protists and bacteria-feeding nematodes are more likely to be important for N mineralization through grazing on microbial biomass, while the effects of enchytraeids and fungal-feeding microarthropods are most likely to be important for DOM production. The model is consistent with experimental evidence and, despite its simplicity, provides a new framework in which the effects of soil fauna on pools and fluxes can be understood. Further, the model highlights our gaps in knowledge, not only for effects of soil fauna on processes, but also for understanding of the soil C and N cycle in general.},

  abstract = {Accurate inventory of tropical peatland is important in order to (a) determine the magnitude of the carbon pool; (b) estimate the scale of transfers of peat-derived greenhouse gases to the atmosphere resulting from land use change; and (c) support carbon emissions reduction policies. We review available information on tropical peatland area and thickness and calculate peat volume and carbon content in order to determine their best estimates and ranges of variation. Our best estimate of tropical peatland area is 441 025 km2 ({$\sim$}11\% of global peatland area) of which 247 778 km2 (56\%) is in Southeast Asia. We estimate the volume of tropical peat to be 1758 Gm3 ({$\sim$}18\textendash 25\% of global peat volume) with 1359 Gm3 in Southeast Asia (77\% of all tropical peat). This new assessment reveals a larger tropical peatland carbon pool than previous estimates, with a best estimate of 88.6 Gt (range 81.7\textendash 91.9 Gt) equal to 15\textendash 19\% of the global peat carbon pool. Of this, 68.5 Gt (77\%) is in Southeast Asia, equal to 11\textendash 14\% of global peat carbon. A single country, Indonesia, has the largest share of tropical peat carbon (57.4 Gt, 65\%), followed by Malaysia (9.1 Gt, 10\%). These data are used to provide revised estimates for Indonesian and Malaysian forest soil carbon pools of 77 and 15 Gt, respectively, and total forest carbon pools (biomass plus soil) of 97 and 19 Gt. Peat carbon contributes 60\% to the total forest soil carbon pool in Malaysia and 74\% in Indonesia. These results emphasize the prominent global and regional roles played by the tropical peat carbon pool and the importance of including this pool in national and regional assessments of terrestrial carbon stocks and the prediction of peat-derived greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {Land use and management influence the magnitude of soil loss. Among the different soil erosion risk factors, the cover-management factor (C-factor) is the one that policy makers and farmers can most readily influence in order to help reduce soil loss rates. The present study proposes a methodology for estimating the C-factor in the European Union (EU), using pan-European datasets (such as CORINE Land Cover), biophysical attributes derived from remote sensing, and statistical data on agricultural crops and practices. In arable lands, the C-factor was estimated using crop statistics (\% of land per crop) and data on management practices such as conservation tillage, plant residues and winter crop cover. The C-factor in non-arable lands was estimated by weighting the range of literature values found according to fractional vegetation cover, which was estimated based on the remote sensing dataset Fcover. The mean C-factor in the EU is estimated to be 0.1043, with an extremely high variability; forests have the lowest mean C-factor (0.00116), and arable lands and sparsely vegetated areas the highest (0.233 and 0.2651, respectively). Conservation management practices (reduced/no tillage, use of cover crops and plant residues) reduce the C-factor by on average 19.1\% in arable lands. The methodology is designed to be a tool for policy makers to assess the effect of future land use and crop rotation scenarios on soil erosion by water. The impact of land use changes (deforestation, arable land expansion) and the effect of policies (such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the push to grow more renewable energy crops) can potentially be quantified with the proposed model. The C-factor data and the statistical input data used are available from the European Soil Data Centre.},

Approximately 77\textendash 86\% of the applied inorganic fertilizer-P in the past 69\textendash 71 years was recovered either in the harvested grain or remained in the top 30 cm of soil, while only 32\% of the applied manure-P was recovered. Microbial biomass C and activities of alkaline phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, and dehydrogenase were significantly higher in the soil treated with cattle manure. Acid phosphomonoesterase activity, however, was significantly higher in soils treated with chemical fertilizers. Results from this study suggested that manure-P is relatively more mobile than inorganic fertilizer-P. Long-term application of cattle manure promoted microbiological activities and P cycling, but did not result in P accumulation to levels close to those in inorganic P fertilizer-treated soils.},

  abstract = {Solid pig manure (240 g kg1 DM) and solid cattle manure (150-180 g kg1 DM) were stored in an open storage facility during spring-summer and autumn conditions for periods of 9-14 weeks during 1994 and 1995. Concentrations of C, N, P and K were determined prior to and after storage, corrected for dry matter losses and distance from the surface. Temperature and, in experiments with pig manure, gas phase composition inside the manure heap were monitored during storage. Nitrogen losses as ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission and leaching were measured, while total denitrification was estimated from mass balance calculations. For both cattle and pig manure there was little difference between seasons with respect to the pattern of decomposition, as reflected in temperature dynamics and C/N turnover. In contrast, there was a distinct difference between manure types. Pig manure was characterized by maximum temperatures of 60-70\textdegree C, although the concentrations of oxygen and methane clearly demonstrated that anaerobic conditions dominated the interior parts of the heap for several weeks. Losses of C and N from pig manure both amounted to c. 50\%. In contrast, the temperature of cattle manure remained close to the air temperature throughout the storage period and cattle manure had lower, not significant losses of C and N. Leaching losses of N constituted 1-4\% with both manure types. Ammonia volatilization from cattle manure constituted 4-5\% of total N, and from pig manure 23-24\%. In pig manure a similar amount of N (23-33\%) could not be accounted for after storage, a loss that was attributed to denitrification. Nitrous oxide emissions amounted to {$<$}2\% of estimated denitrification losses.},

  abstract = {No-till agriculture represents a relatively widely adopted management system that aims to reduce soil erosion, decrease input costs, and sustain long-term crop productivity. However, its impacts on crop yields are variable, and an improved understanding of the factors limiting productivity is needed to support evidence-based management decisions. We conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of various crop and environmental variables on no-till relative to conventional tillage yields using data obtained from peer-reviewed publications (678 studies with 6005 paired observations, representing 50 crops and 63 countries). Side-by-side yield comparisons were restricted to studies comparing conventional tillage to no-till practices in the absence of other cropping system modifications. Crop category was the most important factor influencing the overall yield response to no-till followed by aridity index, residue management, no-till duration, and N rate. No-till yields matched conventional tillage yields for oilseed, cotton, and legume crop categories. Among cereals, the negative impacts of no-till were smallest for wheat (-2.6\%) and largest for rice (-7.5\%) and maize (-7.6\%). No-till performed best under rainfed conditions in dry climates, with yields often being equal to or higher than conventional tillage practices. Yields in the first 1\textendash 2 years following no-till implementation declined for all crops except oilseeds and cotton, but matched conventional tillage yields after 3\textendash 10 years except for maize and wheat in humid climates. Overall, no-till yields were reduced by 12\% without N fertilizer addition and 4\% with inorganic N addition. Our study highlights factors contributing to and/or decreasing no-till yield gaps and suggests that improved targeting and adaptation, possibly including additional system modifications, are necessary to optimize no-till performance and contribute to food production goals. In addition, our results provide a basis for conducting trade-off analyses to support the development of no-till crop management and international development strategies based on available scientific evidence.},

  abstract = {A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields, like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated with SOC stock change (R2=0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32{$\pm$}0.08Mgha-1yr-1 in a mean soil depth of 22cm and during the observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock accumulation of 16.7{$\pm$}1.5Mgha-1 for a soil depth of 22cm. Thus, the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC sequestration of 0.12{$\pm$}0.03PgCyr-1, which would compensate for 8\% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable greenhouse gas budgets.},

  abstract = {Land-use change (LUC) is a major driving factor for the balance of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the global carbon cycle. The temporal dynamic of SOC after LUC is especially important in temperate systems with a long reaction time. On the basis of 95 compiled studies covering 322 sites in the temperate zone, carbon response functions (CRFs) were derived to model the temporal dynamic of SOC after five different LUC types (mean soil depth of 30{$\pm$}6 cm). Grassland establishment caused a long lasting carbon sink with a relative stock change of 128{$\pm$}23\% and afforestation on former cropland a sink of 116{$\pm$}54\%, 100 years after LUC (mean{$\pm$}95\% confidence interval). No new equilibrium was reached within 120 years. In contrast, there was no SOC sink following afforestation of grasslands and 75\% of all observations showed SOC losses, even after 100 years. Only in the forest floor, there was carbon accumulation of 0.38{$\pm$}0.04 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in afforestations adding up to 38{$\pm$}4 Mg ha-1 labile carbon after 100 years. Carbon loss after deforestation (-32{$\pm$}20\%) and grassland conversion to cropland (-36{$\pm$}5\%), was rapid with a new SOC equilibrium being reached after 23 and 17 years, respectively. The change rate of SOC increased with temperature and precipitation but decreased with soil depth and clay content. Subsoil SOC changes followed the trend of the topsoil SOC changes but were smaller (25{$\pm$}5\% of the total SOC changes) and with a high uncertainty due to a limited number of datasets. As a simple and robust model approach, the developed CRFs provide an easily applicable tool to estimate SOC stock changes after LUC to improve greenhouse gas reporting in the framework of UNFCCC.},

With a spatial resolution of 5 arc min (about 9.2 km at the equator), MIRCA2000 provides both irrigated and rainfed crop areas of 26 crop classes for each month of the year. The data set covers all major food crops as well as cotton. Other crops are grouped into categories (perennial, annual, and fodder grasses). It represents multicropping systems and maximizes consistency with census-based national and subnational statistics. According to MIRCA2000, 25\% of the global harvested areas are irrigated, with a cropping intensity (including fallow land) of 1.12, as compared to 0.84 for the sum of rainfed and irrigated harvested crops. For the dominant crops (rice (1.7 million km2 harvested area), wheat (2.1 million km2), and maize (1.5 million km2)), roughly 60\%, 30\%, and 20\% of the harvested areas are irrigated, respectively, and half of the citrus, sugar cane, and cotton areas. While wheat and maize are the crops with the largest rainfed harvested areas (1.5 million km2 and 1.2 million km2, respectively), rice is clearly the crop with the largest irrigated harvested area (1.0 million km2), followed by wheat (0.7 million km2) and maize (0.3 million km2). Using MIRCA2000, 33\% of global crop production and 44\% of total cereal production were determined to come from irrigated agriculture.},

Effects of agricultural soil management can be assessed by soil, crop, and ecosystem models but global assessments are hampered by lack of information on type and spatial distribution. This study describes the generation of a global classification of tillage practices and the spatially explicit mapping of crop-specific tillage systems for around the year 2005.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Tillage practices differ by the kind of equipment used, soil surface and depth affected, timing, and their purpose within the cropping systems. We classified the broad variety of globally relevant tillage practices into six tillage systems. The identified tillage systems were allocated to crop-specific cropland areas with a resolution of 5 arc-minutes. The allocation rules were based on literature findings and combine area information on crop type, water management regime, field size, water erosion, income, and aridity. We allocated national Conservation Agriculture areas to grid cells via a probability-based downscaling approach for 54 reporting countries. The dynamic definition of the allocation rules and accounting for national statistics, such as the share of Conservation Agriculture per country, also allows for deriving datasets for future global soil management scenarios. We present the mapping of six tillage systems: no-tillage in the context of Conservation Agriculture (1.1\&thinsp;Mkm\textsuperscript{2}), traditional annual (4.01\&thinsp;Mkm\textsuperscript{2}), traditional rotational (0.65\&thinsp;Mkm\textsuperscript{2}), rotational (0.74\&thinsp;Mkm\textsuperscript{2}), reduced (0.15\&thinsp;Mkm\textsuperscript{2}), and conventional annual tillage (4.65\&thinsp;Mkm\textsuperscript{2}).

  abstract = {When agricultural land is no longer used for cultivation and allowed to revert to natural vegetation or replanted to perennial vegetation, soil organic carbon can accumulate. This accumulation process essentially reverses some of the effects responsible for soil organic carbon losses from when the land was converted from perennial vegetation. We discuss the essential elements of what is known about soil organic matter dynamics that may result in enhanced soil carbon sequestration with changes in land-use and soil management. We review literature that reports changes in soil organic carbon after changes in land-use that favour carbon accumulation. This data summary provides a guide to approximate rates of SOC sequestration that are possible with management, and indicates the relative importance of some factors that influence the rates of organic carbon sequestration in soil. There is a large variation in the length of time for and the rate at which carbon may accumulate in soil, related to the productivity of the recovering vegetation, physical and biological conditions in the soil, and the past history of soil organic carbon inputs and physical disturbance. Maximum rates of C accumulation during the early aggrading stage of perennial vegetation growth, while substantial, are usually much less than 100~g~C~m-2~y-1. Average rates of accumulation are similar for forest or grassland establishment: 33.8~g~C~m-2~y-1 and 33.2~g~C~m-2~y-1, respectively. These observed rates of soil organic C accumulation, when combined with the small amount of land area involved, are insufficient to account for a significant fraction of the missing C in the global carbon cycle as accumulating in the soils of formerly agricultural land.},

Here we provide the first dedicated assessment into how the GHG emitting potential of various manures responds to the different stages of the manure management continuum (e.g., from feed pen surface vs stockpiled). The research is important from the perspective of manure application to agricultural soils. Manures studied included: manure from beef feedpen surfaces and stockpiles; poultry broiler litter (8-week batch); fresh and composted egg layer litter; and fresh and composted piggery litter. Gases assessed were methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), the two principal agricultural GHGs. We employed proven protocols to determine the manures' ultimate CH4 producing potential. We also devised a novel incubation experiment to elucidate their N2O emitting potential; a measure for which no established methods exist. We found lower CH4 potentials in manures from later stages in their management sequence compared with earlier stages, but only by a factor of 0.65\texttimes. Moreover, for the beef manures this decrease was not significant (P \&lt; 0.05). Nitrous oxide emission potential was significantly positively (P \&lt; 0.05) correlated with C/N ratios yet showed no obvious relationship with manure management stage. Indeed, N2O emissions from the composted egg manure were considerably (13\texttimes ) and significantly (P \&lt; 0.05) higher than that of the fresh egg manure. Our study demonstrates that manures from all stages of the manure management continuum potentially entail significant GHG risk when applied to arable landscapes. Efforts to harness manure resources need to account for this.},

  abstract = {Conservation agriculture (CA) is widely promoted as a sustainable agricultural management strategy with the potential to alleviate some of the adverse effects of modern, industrial agriculture such as large-scale soil erosion, nutrient leaching and overexploitation of water resources. Moreover, agricultural land managed under CA is proposed to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation through reduced emission of greenhouse gases, increased solar radiation reflection, and the sustainable use of soil and water resources. Due to the lack of official reporting schemes, the amount of agricultural land managed under CA systems is uncertain and spatially explicit information about the distribution of CA required for various modeling studies is missing. Here, we present an approach to downscale present-day national-level estimates of CA to a 5 arcminute regular grid, based on multicriteria analysis. We provide a best estimate of CA distribution and an uncertainty range in the form of a low and high estimate of CA distribution, reflecting the inconsistency in CA definitions. We also design two scenarios of the potential future development of CA combining present-day data and an assessment of the potential for implementation using biophysical and socioeconomic factors. By our estimates, 122-215Mha or 9\%-15\% of global arable land is currently managed under CA systems. The lower end of the range represents CA as an integrated system of permanent no-tillage, crop residue management and crop rotations, while the high estimate includes a wider range of areas primarily devoted to temporary no-tillage or reduced tillage operations. Our scenario analysis suggests a future potential of CA in the range of 533-1130Mha (38\%-81\% of global arable land). Our estimates can be used in various ecosystem modeling applications and are expected to help identifying more realistic climate mitigation and adaptation potentials of agricultural practices.},

One key aspect of the interplay of E LUC and S L is the role of agricultural processes in land-use change emissions, which has not yet been clearly quantified at the global scale. Here we assess the effect of representing agricultural land management in a dynamic global vegetation model. Accounting for harvest, grazing and tillage resulted in cumulative E LUC since 1850 ca. 70\% larger than in simulations ignoring these processes, but also changed the timescale over which these emissions occurred and led to underestimations of the carbon sequestered by possible future reforestation actions. The vast majority of Earth system models in the recent IPCC Fifth Assessment Report omit these processes, suggesting either an overestimation in their present-day S T , or an underestimation of S L , of up to 1.0 Pg C a -1 . Management processes influencing crop productivity per se are important for food supply, but were found to have little influence on E LUC .},

  abstract = {Agroecosystems have a critical role in the terrestrial carbon cycling process. Soil organic carbon (SOC) in cropland is of great importance for mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide increases and for global food security. With an understanding of soil carbon saturation, we analyzed the datasets from 95 global long-term agricultural experiments distributed across a vast area spanning wide ranges of temperate, subtropical and tropical climates. We then developed a statistical model for estimating SOC sequestration potential in cropland. The model is driven by air temperature, precipitation, soil clay content and pH, and explains 58\% of the variation in the observed soil carbon saturation (n=76). Model validation using independent data observed in China yielded a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.74 (n=19, P{$<$}0.001). Model sensitivity analysis suggested that soils with high clay content and low pH in the cold, humid regions possess a larger carbon sequestration potential than other soils. As a case study, we estimated the SOC sequestration potential by applying the model in Henan Province. Model estimations suggested that carbon (C) density at the saturation state would reach an average of 32 t C ha-1 in the top 0\textendash 20 cm soil depth. Using SOC density in the 1990s as a reference, cropland soils in Henan Province are expected to sequester an additional 100 Tg C in the future.},

  abstract = {Understanding the origin of the carbon (C) stabilised in soils is crucial in order to device management practices that will foster C accumulation in soils. The relative contributions to soil C pools of roots vs. shoots is one aspect that has been mostly overlooked, although it appears a key factor that drives the fate of plant tissue C either as mineralized CO(2) or as stabilized soil organic matter (SOM). Available studies on the subject consistently indicate that root C has a longer residence time in soil than shoot C. From the few studies with complete datasets, we estimated that the mean residence time in soils of root-derived C is 2.4 times that of shoot-derived C. Our analyses indicate that this value is biased neither by an underestimation of root contributions, as exudation was considered in the analysis, nor by a priming effect of shoot litter on SOM. Here, we discuss the main SOM stabilisation mechanisms with respect to their ability to specifically protect root-derived SOM. Comparing in situ and incubation experiments suggests that the higher chemical recalcitrance of root tissues as compared to that of shoots is responsible for only a small portion, i.e. about one fourth, of the difference in mean residence time in soils of root-derived vs. shoot-derived C. This suggests that SOM protection mechanisms other than chemical recalcitrance are also enhanced by root activities: (1) physico-chemical protection, especially in deeper horizons, (2) micrometer-scale physical protection through myccorhiza and root-hair activities, and (3) chemical interactions with metal ions. The impact of environmental conditions within deeper soil layers on root C stabilisation appear difficult to assess, but is likely, if anything, to further increase the ratio between the mean residence time of root vs. shoot C in soils. Future advances are expected from isotopic studies conducted at the molecular level, which will help unravel the fate of individual shoot and root compounds, such as cutins and suberins, throughout soil profiles.},

With estimated standing populations of 1.43 billion cattle, 1.87 billion sheep and goats, 0.98 billion pigs, and 19.60 billion chickens, reliable and accessible information on the distribution and abundance of livestock is needed for a many reasons. These include analyses of the social and economic aspects of the livestock sector; the environmental impacts of livestock such as the production and management of waste, greenhouse gas emissions and livestock-related land-use change; and large-scale public health and epidemiological investigations. The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, produced in 2007, provided modelled livestock densities of the world, adjusted to match official (FAOSTAT) national estimates for the reference year 2005, at a spatial resolution of 3 minutes of arc (about 5\texttimes 5 km at the equator). Recent methodological improvements have significantly enhanced these distributions: more up-to date and detailed sub-national livestock statistics have been collected; a new, higher resolution set of predictor variables is used; and the analytical procedure has been revised and extended to include a more systematic assessment of model accuracy and the representation of uncertainties associated with the predictions. This paper describes the current approach in detail and presents new global distribution maps at 1 km resolution for cattle, pigs and chickens, and a partial distribution map for ducks. These digital layers are made publically available via the Livestock Geo-Wiki (http://www.livestock.geo-wiki.org), as will be the maps of other livestock types as they are produced.},

  abstract = {The micrometeorological technique of eddy covariance is a powerful tool for characterizing the carbon (C) budget of terrestrial ecosystems. However, few attempts have been made to link canopy-scale eddy exchange to soil C processes. Here we develop a simple means of using calculations derived from a global database of eddy flux measurements to examine the role of climate on soil C decomposition rates. We then compare the results of the eddy covariance calculations to the temperature dependence of soil C residence times determined by four common methods: laboratory incubations, direct soil respiration measurements, radiocarbon uptake, and stable C isotope change following land conversion. In all five methods, the soil organic C turnover time decreases exponentially with increasing mean annual temperature. The similar slopes and intercepts of the eddy flux and chamber measurements lend support for the robustness of micrometeorological techniques in measuring respiration. The similarities in the response of soil C turnover to temperature for the eddy flux and 14C-derived turnover times is especially encouraging in that bomb-14C measurements do not rely on any of the assumptions that were used to calculate soil C turnover from eddy flux data. However, the 13C isotope method yields a significantly different slope and intercept than the other three techniques. The results of this work reinforce the recognized temperature dependence of soil C turnover and suggest that eddy flux experiments are a useful and additional approach for studying the soil C budget.},

Estimating the size and spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss due to land use and land cover change has been difficult but is a critical step in understanding whether SOC sequestration can be an effective climate mitigation strategy. In this study, a machine learning-based model was fitted using a global compilation of SOC data and the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) land use data in combination with climatic, landform and lithology covariates. Model results compared favorably with a global compilation of paired plot studies. Projection of this model onto a world without agriculture indicated a global carbon debt due to agriculture of 133 Pg C for the top 2 m of soil, with the rate of loss increasing dramatically in the past 200 years. The HYDE classes ``grazing'' and ``cropland'' contributed nearly equally to the loss of SOC. There were higher percent SOC losses on cropland but since more than twice as much land is grazed, slightly higher total losses were found from grazing land. Important spatial patterns of SOC loss were found: Hotspots of SOC loss coincided with some major cropping regions as well as semiarid grazing regions, while other major agricultural zones showed small losses and even net gains in SOC. This analysis has demonstrated that there are identifiable regions which can be targeted for SOC restoration efforts.},

Here, we study the spatial and temporal dynamics of these two processes under scenarios of climate change and evaluate their influence on the carbon balance of the permafrost zone. We use the dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL, which simulates plant physiological and ecological processes and includes a newly developed discrete layer energy balance permafrost module and a vertical carbon distribution within the soil layer. The model is able to reproduce the interactions between vegetation and soil carbon dynamics as well as to simulate dynamic permafrost changes resulting from changes in the climate. We find that vegetation responds more rapidly to warming of the permafrost zone than soil carbon pools due to long time lags in permafrost thawing, and that the initial simulated net uptake of carbon may continue for some decades of warming. However, once the turning point is reached, if carbon release exceeds uptake, carbon is lost irreversibly from the system and cannot be compensated for by increasing vegetation carbon input. Our analysis highlights the importance of including dynamic vegetation and long-term responses into analyses of permafrost zone carbon budgets.},

Different versions of the model have been developed and applied to evaluate the role of natural and managed ecosystems in the Earth system and the potential impacts of global environmental change. A comprehensive model description of the new model version, LPJmL4, is provided in a companion paper (Schaphoff et al., 2018c).

Specifically, we evaluate LPJmL4 against various datasets from in situ measurement sites, satellite observations, and agricultural yield statistics. We apply a range of metrics to evaluate the quality of the model to simulate stocks and flows of carbon and water in natural and managed ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales. We show that an advanced phenology scheme improves the simulation of seasonal fluctuations in the atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration, while the permafrost scheme improves estimates of carbon stocks.

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon can be sequestered through various land management options depending on the soil organic carbon status at the beginning of a management period. This initial soil organic carbon status results from a certain soil management history in a certain soil climate regime. Similarly, the prediction of future carbon storage depends on the time path of future soil management. Unfortunately, the number of possible management trajectories reaches non-computable levels so fast that explicit representations of future management trajectories are infeasible for most existing empirical land use decision models. Not surprisingly, the impact of different management trajectories has been ignored. This article proposes a computationally feasible mathematical programming method for integration of soil state dependent sequestration rates in dynamic land use decision optimization models. The possible soil organic carbon range is divided in several adjacent carbon states. For each soil management practice, location, and initial soil organic carbon state, transition probabilities of moving into a different or remaining in the same state are computed. Subsequently, these probabilities are used in dynamic equations to update the soil organic carbon level before and after each period. To illustrate the impacts of this Markov chain based method, a case study portraying Australian wheat farmers is conducted.},

  abstract = {The impact of different arable farming practices on soil erosion is only partly resolved, and the effect of conservation tillage practices in organic agriculture on sediment loss has rarely been tested in the field. This study investigated rainfall-induced interrill sediment loss in a long-term replicated arable farming system and tillage experiment (the FAST trial) with four different cropping systems: (1) organic farming with intensive tillage, (2) organic farming with reduced tillage, (3) conventional farming with intensive tillage, and (4) conventional farming with no tillage. Measurements were carried out under simulated heavy rainfall events with runoff plots in 2014 (fallow land after winter wheat) and 2017 (during maize growth). Organic farming decreased mean sediment delivery compared to conventional farming by 30\% (0.54 t ha-1 h-1). This study demonstrated that reduced tillage in organic farming decreased sediment delivery (0.73 t ha-1 h-1) compared to intensively tilled organic plots (1.87 t ha-1 h-1) by 61\%. Nevertheless, the combination of conventional farming and no tillage showed the lowest sediment delivery (0.24 t ha-1 h-1), whereas intensively tilled conventional plots revealed the highest delivery (3.46 t ha-1 h-1). Erosion rates were much higher in June during maize growth (2.92 t ha-1 h-1) compared to those of fallow land after winter wheat (0.23 t ha-1 h-1). Soil surface cover and soil organic matter were the best predictors for reduced sediment delivery, and living plant cover from weeds in reduced organic treatments appeared to protect soil surfaces better than plant residues in conventional, no-tillage plots. Soil erosion rates were significantly lower when soil cover was above 30\%. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that both organic farming and conservation agriculture reduce soil losses and showed for the first time that reduced tillage practices are a major improvement in organic farming when it comes to soil erosion control.},

  abstract = {The Lund\textendash Potsdam\textendash Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ) combines process-based, large-scale representations of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and land-atmosphere carbon and water exchanges in a modular framework. Features include feedback through canopy conductance between photosynthesis and transpiration and interactive coupling between these `fast' processes and other ecosystem processes including resource competition, tissue turnover, population dynamics, soil organic matter and litter dynamics and fire disturbance. Ten plants functional types (PFTs) are differentiated by physiological, morphological, phenological, bioclimatic and fire-response attributes. Resource competition and differential responses to fire between PFTs influence their relative fractional cover from year to year. Photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics are modelled on a daily time step, while vegetation structure and PFT population densities are updated annually. Simulations have been made over the industrial period both for specific sites where field measurements were available for model evaluation, and globally on a 0.5\textdegree\textdegree ~\texttimes ~0.5\textdegree\textdegree{} grid. Modelled vegetation patterns are consistent with observations, including remotely sensed vegetation structure and phenology. Seasonal cycles of net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture compare well with local measurements. Global carbon exchange fields used as input to an atmospheric tracer transport model (TM2) provided a good fit to observed seasonal cycles of CO2 concentration at all latitudes. Simulated inter-annual variability of the global terrestrial carbon balance is in phase with and comparable in amplitude to observed variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2. Global terrestrial carbon and water cycle parameters (pool sizes and fluxes) lie within their accepted ranges. The model is being used to study past, present and future terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, biochemical and biophysical interactions between ecosystems and the atmosphere, and as a component of coupled Earth system models.},

Crop production is by far the single largest cause of this anthropogenic alteration. Inorganic fertilizers now provide 80 Tg N yr-1 (Tg = 1012 g), managed (symbiotic) biofixation adds about 20 Tg N yr-1, and between 28 and 36 Tg N yr-1 are recycled in organic wastes. Anthropogenic inputs (including N in seeds and irrigation water) now supply about 85\% of 170 (151\textendash 186) Tg N reaching the world's cropland every year. About half of this input, 85 Tg N yr-1, is taken up by harvested crops and their residues. Quantification of N losses from crop fields is beset by major uncertainties. Losses to the atmosphere (denitrification and volatilization) amount to 26\textendash 60 Tg N yr-1, while waters receive (from leaching and erosion) 32\textendash 45 Tg N yr-1. These N losses are the major reason behind the growing concerns about the enrichment of the biosphere with reactive N. The best evidence suggests that in spite of some significant local and regional losses, the world's agricultural land accumulates N. The addition of 3\textendash 4 billion people before the year 2050 will require further substantial increases of N input in cropping, but a large share of this demand can come from improved efficiency of N fertilizer use.},

Estimation of Carbon in Organic Soils\textemdash Sequestration and Emissions (ECOSSE) is a model that allows simulations of soil C and N turnover in both mineral and organic soils using only the limited meteorological, land-use and soil data that is available at the national scale. Because it is able to function at field as well as national scales if appropriate input data are used, field-scale evaluations can be used to determine uncertainty in national simulations. Here we present an evaluation of the uncertainty expected in national-scale simulations of Scotland, using data from the National Soil Inventory of Scotland. This data set provides measurements of C change for the range of soils, climates and land-use types found across Scotland. The simulated values show a high degree of association with the measurements in both total C and change in C content of the soil. Over all sites where land-use change occurred, the average deviation between the simulated and measured values of percentage change in soil C was less than the experimental error (11\% simulation error, 53\% measurement error). This suggests that the uncertainty in the national-scale simulations will be \textasciitilde 11\%. Only a small bias in the simulations was observed compared to the measured values, suggesting that a small underestimate of the change in soil C should be expected at the national scale (\textendash 4\%).},

  abstract = {Soils are subject to varying degrees of direct or indirect human disturbance, constituting a major global change driver. Factoring out natural from direct and indirect human influence is not always straightforward, but some human activities have clear impacts. These include land-use change, land management and land degradation (erosion, compaction, sealing and salinization). The intensity of land use also exerts a great impact on soils, and soils are also subject to indirect impacts arising from human activity, such as acid deposition (sulphur and nitrogen) and heavy metal pollution. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding of these global change pressures on soils, identify knowledge gaps and research challenges and highlight actions and policies to minimize adverse environmental impacts arising from these global change drivers. Soils are central to considerations of what constitutes sustainable intensification. Therefore, ensuring that vulnerable and high environmental value soils are considered when protecting important habitats and ecosystems, will help to reduce the pressure on land from global change drivers. To ensure that soils are protected as part of wider environmental efforts, a global soil resilience programme should be considered, to monitor, recover or sustain soil fertility and function, and to enhance the ecosystem services provided by soils. Soils cannot, and should not, be considered in isolation of the ecosystems that they underpin and vice versa. The role of soils in supporting ecosystems and natural capital needs greater recognition. The lasting legacy of the International Year of Soils in 2015 should be to put soils at the centre of policy supporting environmental protection and sustainable development.},

Agricultural soils may also act as a sink or source for CO2, but the net flux is small.

Lower, but still significant mitigation potential is provided by water and rice management, set-aside, land use change and agroforestry, livestock management and manure management. The global technical mitigation potential from agriculture (excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass) by 2030, considering all gases, is estimated to be approximately 5500\textendash 6000 Mt CO2-eq. yr-1, with economic potentials of approximately 1500\textendash 1600, 2500\textendash 2700 and 4000\textendash 4300 Mt CO2-eq. yr-1 at carbon prices of up to 20, up to 50 and up to 100 US\$ t CO2-eq.-1, respectively.

Since SOC content of soils cannot be easily measured, a key barrier to implementing programmes to increase SOC at large scale, is the need for credible and reliable measurement/monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) platforms, both for national reporting and for emissions trading. Without such platforms, investments could be considered risky. In this paper, we review methods and challenges of measuring SOC change directly in soils, before examining some recent novel developments that show promise for quantifying SOC. We describe how repeat soil surveys are used to estimate changes in SOC over time, and how long-term experiments and space-for-time substitution sites can serve as sources of knowledge and can be used to test models, and as potential benchmark sites in global frameworks to estimate SOC change. We briefly consider models that can be used to simulate and project change in SOC and examine the MRV platforms for SOC change already in use in various countries/regions. In the final section, we bring together the various components described in this review, to describe a new vision for a global framework for MRV of SOC change, to support national and international initiatives seeking to effect change in the way we manage our soils.},

A few GGR options, such as afforestation, BECCS, and biochar potentially impact negatively some NCPs and SDGs, particularly when implemented at scale, largely through competition for land.

In this paper, we explore the constraints and barriers to implementation important for GHG mitigation in agriculture. We also examine how climate and non-climate policy in different regions of the world has affected agricultural GHG emissions in the recent past, and how it may affect emissions and mitigation implementation in the future. We examine the links between mitigation and adaptation and drives for sustainable development and the potential for agricultural GHG mitigation in the future. We describe how some countries have initiated climate and non-climate policies believed to have direct effects or synergistic effects on mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture. Global sharing of innovative technologies for efficient use of land resources and agricultural chemicals, to eliminate poverty and malnutrition, will significantly mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture. Previous studies have shown that as less than 30\% of the total biophysical potential for agricultural GHG mitigation might be achieved by 2030, due to price- and non-price-related barriers to implementation. The challenge for successful agricultural GHG mitigation will be to remove these barriers by implementing creative policies. Identifying policies that provide benefits for climate, as well as for aspects of economic, social and environmental sustainability, will be critical for ensuring that effective GHG mitigation options are widely implemented in the future.},

A recent analysis of NETs, including direct air capture, enhanced weathering, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation/deforestation, showed that all NETs have significant limits to implementation, including economic cost, energy requirements, land use, and water use. In this paper, I assess the potential for negative emissions from soil carbon sequestration and biochar addition to land, and also the potential global impacts on land use, water, nutrients, albedo, energy and cost. Results indicate that soil carbon sequestration and biochar have useful negative emission potential (each 0.7 GtCeq. yr-1) and that they potentially have lower impact on land, water use, nutrients, albedo, energy requirement and cost, so have fewer disadvantages than many NETs. Limitations of soil carbon sequestration as a NET centre around issues of sink saturation and reversibility. Biochar could be implemented in combination with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Current integrated assessment models do not represent soil carbon sequestration or biochar. Given the negative emission potential of SCS and biochar and their potential advantages compared to other NETs, efforts should be made to include these options within IAMs, so that their potential can be explored further in comparison with other NETs for climate stabilization.},

  abstract = {Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 methodologies commonly underpin project-scale carbon accounting for changes in land use and management and are used in frameworks for Life Cycle Assessment and carbon footprinting of food and energy crops. These methodologies were intended for use at large spatial scales. This can introduce error in predictions at finer spatial scales. There is an urgent need for development and implementation of higher tier methodologies that can be applied at fine spatial scales (e.g. farm/project/plantation) for food and bioenergy crop greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting to facilitate decision making in the land-based sectors. Higher tier methods have been defined by IPCC and must be well evaluated and operate across a range of domains (e.g. climate region, soil type, crop type, topography), and must account for land use transitions and management changes being implemented. Furthermore, the data required to calibrate and drive the models used at higher tiers need to be available and applicable at fine spatial resolution, covering the meteorological, soil, cropping system and management domains, with quantified uncertainties. Testing the reliability of the models will require data either from sites with repeated measurements or from chronosequences. We review current global capability for estimating changes in soil carbon at fine spatial scales and present a vision for a framework capable of quantifying land use change and management impacts on soil carbon, which could be used for addressing issues such as bioenergy and biofuel sustainability, food security, forest protection, and direct/indirect impacts of land use change. The aim of this framework is to provide a globally accepted standard of carbon measurement and modelling appropriate for GHG accounting that could be applied at project to national scales (allowing outputs to be scaled up to a country level), to address the impacts of land use and land management change on soil carbon.},

  abstract = {When assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and its climate change (CC) mitigation potential at global scale, the dynamic nature of soil carbon storage and interventions to foster it should be taken into account. Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then SOC will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new SOC equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential SOC sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding CC mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87-year (2014\textendash 2100) global SOC sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1.9\textendash 3.9\% of the SRES-A2 projected 87-year anthropogenic emissions. SOC sequestration would peak 2032\textendash 33, at that time reaching 4.3\textendash 8.9\% of the projected annual SRES-A2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, SOC sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing SOC for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global significance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC.},

  abstract = {Recent global agreements on greenhouse gas emission reductions have reinforced the need to develop cost-effective offset programs that can be implemented to help augment emission reductions. One approach to offset carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions may be to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks by reducing soil disturbance by changing from conventional tillage (CT) to no tillage (NT). In this analysis, the cost to increase SOC sequestration achieved on cropland by changing from CT to NT is estimated. The marginal cost of increasing SOC is determined by the amount SOC can be increased and the difference in profit of changing from conventional to no-till. Landowner costs and profit are derived from crop enterprise budgets, county yield data, and regional crop prices. A risk factor is also used to increase the cost of no-till adoption to account for the apparent reluctance of landowners to adopt no-till. The SOC sequestration potential on corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) cropland combined is about 49.1 Tg CO2 year-1 (1 Tg = 1012 g) of which 47.6 Tg CO2 year-1 (nearly 97\%) could be attained for less than \$20-Mg-1 CO2 (1 Mg = 106 g). When the risk factor is included in the assessment, over 19.7 Tg CO2 year-1 could be attained for less than \$20-Mg-1 CO2. The analysis demonstrates that SOC sequestration through changes from CT to NT on corn and soybean land could economically offset a portion of CO2 emissions.},

Small changes in the soil organic carbon stock could result in significant impacts on the atmospheric carbon concentration. The fluxes of soil organic carbon vary in response to a host of potential environmental and anthropogenic driving factors. Scientists worldwide are contemplating questions such as: `What is the average net change in soil organic carbon due to environmental conditions or management practices?', `How can soil organic carbon sequestration be enhanced to achieve some mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide?' and `Will this secure soil quality?'. These questions are far reaching, because maintaining and improving the world's soil resource is imperative to providing sufficient food and fibre to a growing population. Additional challenges are expected through climate change and its potential to increase food shortages. This review highlights knowledge of the amount of carbon stored in soils globally, and the potential for carbon sequestration in soil. It also discusses successful methods and models used to determine and estimate carbon pools and fluxes. This knowledge and technology underpins decisions to protect the soil resource.},

  abstract = {The food security\textendash climate change nexus rapidly gains momentum. Soil degradation plays an important role in this context while dealing with, for example, the productive capacity of our soil resources or carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. However, little has been done to assess the pristine soil conditions despite the fact that these provide the basis to put changes into context. Various methodologies have been developed to assess the global distribution of current soil conditions. We used the S-World methodology that was developed to generate global soil property maps for environmental modelling studies. Up till now, the S-World methodology assessed current soil conditions by disaggregating the Harmonized World Soil Database using detailed information on climate, topography, land cover, and land use. This study used the S-World methodology to derive global soil conditions under natural vegetation. A large number of natural areas around the globe were identified for which land cover, expressed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, could be successfully correlated to environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and topography. Using this relation in regression kriging, the vegetation index under natural conditions was derived for the entire globe. Subsequently, the S-World methodology was used to calculate the soil properties under natural land cover and absence of human land use. Soil property maps for natural and current conditions were compared and showed large local differences. The results indicate that there are major changes due to land cover and land use change and that these changes are concentrated on the globe. The results are the basis for future assessments on, for example, land degradation, food security, or the sustainable development goals. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Authors.

The Bern carbon cycle-climate model was used with land use maps from HYDE3.0 for 1700 to 2000 A.D. and from post-SRES scenarios for this century. Cropland and pasture expansion each cause about half of the simulated net carbon emissions of 188 Gt C over the industrial period and 1.1 Gt C yr-1 in the 1990s, implying a residual terrestrial sink of 113 Gt C and of 1.8 Gt C yr-1, respectively. Direct CO2 emissions due to land conversion as simulated in book-keeping models dominate carbon fluxes due to land use in the past. They are, however, mitigated by 25\% through the feedback of increased atmospheric CO2 stimulating uptake. CO2 stimulated sinks are largely lost when natural lands are converted. Past land use change has eliminated potential future carbon sinks equivalent to emissions of 80\textendash 150 Gt C over this century. They represent a commitment of past land use change, which accounts for 70\% of the future land use flux in the scenarios considered. Pre-industrial land use emissions are estimated to 45 Gt C at most, implying a maximum change in Holocene atmospheric CO2 of 3 ppm. This is not compatible with the hypothesis that early anthropogenic CO2 emissions prevented a new glacial period.},

The C-TOOL model was developed to simulate farm- and regional-scale effects of management on medium- to long-term SOC storage in the profile of well-drained agricultural mineral soils. C-TOOL uses three SOC pools for both the topsoil (0\textendash 25cm) and the subsoil (25\textendash 100cm), and applies temperature-dependent first order kinetics to regulate C turnover. C-TOOL also enables the simulation of 14C turnover. The simple model structure facilitates calibration and requires few inputs (mean monthly air temperature, soil clay content, soil C/N ratio and C in organic inputs). The model was parameterised using data from 19 treatments drawn from seven long-term field experiments in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. It was found that the initial SOC content had to be optimised for each experiment, but also that one set of values for other model parameters could be applied at all sites. With this set of parameters, C-TOOL can be applied more widely to evaluate effects of management options on SOC storage in temperate agricultural soils. C-TOOL simulates observed losses of SOC in soils under intensive agricultural use and the gain in SOC derived from large inputs of animal manure and inclusion of perennial grassland. The model simulates changes in SOC for the entire profile, but lack of data on subsoil SOC storage hampers a proper model evaluation. Experimental verification of management effects on subsoil C storage, subsoil C inputs from roots, and vertical transport of C in the soil profile remains prioritised research areas.},

Recycling these OAs in agriculture possesses several advantages such as improving plant growth, yield, soil carbon content, and microbial biomass and activity. Nevertheless, OA applications hold some disadvantages such as nutrient eutrophication and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Agriculture sector plays a vital role in GHG emission (carbon dioxide\textemdash{} CO2, methane\textemdash{} CH4, and nitrous oxide\textemdash{} N2O). Though CH4 and N2O are emitted in less quantity than CO2, they are 21 and 310 times more powerful in global warming potential, respectively. Although there have been reviews on the role of mineral fertilizer application on GHG emission, there has been no comprehensive review on the effect of OA application on GHG emission in agricultural soils. The review starts with the quantification of various OAs used in agriculture that include manures, biosolids, and crop residues along with their role in improving soil health. Then, it discusses four major OA induced-GHG emission processes (i.e., priming effect, methanogenesis, nitrification, and denitrification) by highlighting the impact of OA application on GHG emission from soil. For example, globally 10\texttimes 107Mg biosolids are produced annually which can result in the potential emission of 530Gg of CH4 and 60Gg of N2O. The article then aims to highlight the soil, climatic, and OA factors affecting OA induced-GHG emission and the management practices to mitigate the emission. This review emphasizes the future research needs in relation to nitrogen and carbon dynamics in soil to broaden the use of OAs in agriculture to maintain soil health with minimum impact on GHG emission from agriculture.},

The manure was then composted in windrows to investigate C, nutrient, and mass loss during the composting process. Feeding cycle mass balance results indicated that N losses from the bedded pack ranged from 24 to 36\%. Composting treatments included construction with and without a manure spreader and subsequent management with and without turning. Significantly greater losses of mass, C, K, and Na were found in the turned windrow treatment. However, composting in turned windrows proceeded at a much faster rate, with temperatures dropping out of the thermophilic range within 21 days. Composting without turning was less rapid, with temperatures remaining in the thermophilic range to the end of the 42-day trial. Mass reduction and C loss was significantly higher in the turned windrows than in the unturned windrows. Nitrogen loss was between 37 and 60\% of the initial N, with no significant effect from turning. It appears that the low initial C:N ratio (between 9:1 and 12:1) was the most critical factor affecting the N loss in this composting process. Phosphorus, K, and Na losses were also high during composting, which could be due to runoff and leaching from the hoop manure. These elements may be significant contributors to surface and groundwater pollution through runoff and leaching. Additional research is planned to understand the extent of losses through volatilization, runoff, and leaching during composting.},

  abstract = {Stocks of soil organic carbon represent a large component of the carbon cycle that may participate in climate change feedbacks, particularly on decadal and centennial timescales. For Earth system models (ESMs), the ability to accurately represent the global distribution of existing soil carbon stocks is a prerequisite for accurately predicting future carbon\textendash climate feedbacks. We compared soil carbon simulations from 11 model centers to empirical data from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD). Model estimates of global soil carbon stocks ranged from 510 to 3040 Pg C, compared to an estimate of 1260 Pg C (with a 95\% confidence interval of 890\textendash 1660 Pg C) from the HWSD. Model simulations for the high northern latitudes fell between 60 and 820 Pg C, compared to 500 Pg C (with a 95\% confidence interval of 380\textendash 620 Pg C) for the NCSCD and 290 Pg C for the HWSD. Global soil carbon varied 5.9 fold across models in response to a 2.6-fold variation in global net primary productivity (NPP) and a 3.6-fold variation in global soil carbon turnover times. Model\textendash data agreement was moderate at the biome level (R2 values ranged from 0.38 to 0.97 with a mean of 0.75); however, the spatial distribution of soil carbon simulated by the ESMs at the 1\textdegree{} scale was not well correlated with the HWSD (Pearson correlation coefficients less than 0.4 and root mean square errors from 9.4 to 20.8 kg C m-2). In northern latitudes where the two data sets overlapped, agreement between the HWSD and the NCSCD was poor (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.33), indicating uncertainty in empirical estimates of soil carbon. We found that a reduced complexity model dependent on NPP and soil temperature explained much of the 1\textdegree{} spatial variation in soil carbon within most ESMs (R2 values between 0.62 and 0.93 for 9 of 11 model centers). However, the same reduced complexity model only explained 10\% of the spatial variation in HWSD soil carbon when driven by observations of NPP and temperature, implying that other drivers or processes may be more important in explaining observed soil carbon distributions. The reduced complexity model also showed that differences in simulated soil carbon across ESMs were driven by differences in simulated NPP and the parameterization of soil heterotrophic respiration (inter-model R2 = 0.93), not by structural differences between the models. Overall, our results suggest that despite fair global-scale agreement with observational data and moderate agreement at the biome scale, most ESMs cannot reproduce grid-scale variation in soil carbon and may be missing key processes. Future work should focus on improving the simulation of driving variables for soil carbon stocks and modifying model structures to include additional processes.},

  abstract = {Irrigation has a critical role for crop production worldwide. In particular, irrigation is a major issue due to the growing food demand and climate change. Irrigation affects yields and the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and N2O by soils. Here, we review the effect of irrigation on soil organic carbon and N2O emissions. We analysed 22 investigations in various regions of the world. Interactions between irrigation, soil and management factors are described. The main points are: (1) The influence of irrigation is strongly dependent on climate and initial soil organic carbon content. For instance, irrigation of cultivated desert soils led to an average increase of 90 \% to over 500 \% of soil organic carbon. (2) Irrigation of semiarid regions increases soil organic carbon by 11 \% to 35 \%. (3) No consistent effects of irrigation were observed in humid regions. In many cases, N2O emissions increase after precipitation or irrigation. (4) Comparison of N2O emissions from irrigated and non-irrigated fields shows that availability of reactive nitrogen compounds controls increased N2O emissions under irrigation, in most cases. Here, increases of about 50 \% to 140 \% in N2O emissions were reported.},

Part of the problem is the emphasis on short-term studies and processes that dominate C balance at the point or soil profile scale, whereas other processes that dominate over longer timescales and larger spatial scales may actually be more important for determining the carbon balance of soils in a region. Radiocarbon is one of the only tools to study the dynamics of C in soils on decadal to millennial timescales. It provides a means for directly testing models of organic matter dynamics in ecosystems and, when measured in respired CO2 or dissolved organic carbon (DOC), provides evidence of shifts in microbial metabolism. This review explores the application of this underutilized tool, with an emphasis on conceptual advances made using the state-factor approach and on detecting processes causing abrupt change in soil C stores.},

It is a way of intensifying agricultural production and diversifying the crop mix for economic and environmental benefits. Here we present the first global gridded data set of multiple cropping systems and quantify the physical area of more than 200 systems, the global multiple cropping area and the potential for increasing cropping intensity. We use national and sub-national data on monthly crop-specific growing areas around the year 2000 (1998\textendash 2002) for 26 crop groups, global cropland extent and crop harvested areas to identify sequential cropping systems of two or three crops with non-overlapping growing seasons. We find multiple cropping systems on 135 million hectares (12\% of global cropland) with 85 million hectares in irrigated agriculture. 34\%, 13\% and 10\% of the rice, wheat and maize area, respectively are under multiple cropping, demonstrating the importance of such cropping systems for cereal production. Harvesting currently single cropped areas a second time could increase global harvested areas by 87\textendash 395 million hectares, which is about 45\% lower than previous estimates. Some scenarios of intensification indicate that it could be enough land to avoid expanding physical cropland into other land uses but attainable intensification will depend on the local context and the crop yields attainable in the second cycle and its related environmental costs.},

  abstract = {Organic manures arising from livestock production provide a source of plant nutrients when applied to agricultural land. However, only about 52\% of the N excreted by livestock is estimated to be recycled as a plant nutrient. The \-greatest losses of N from livestock excreta and manures are as gaseous emissions. These emissions are in the form of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Ammonia forms particles in the atmosphere which reduce visibility and may also harm human health, and when deposited to land NH3 causes nutrient enrichment of soil. Nitrous oxide and CH4 contribute significantly to global warming and N2O can also cause the breakdown of the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. We established a database of emissions from solid manures. Statistical analysis provided new information, focussing on developing emission factors, emission algorithms and also new understanding of emission patterns from solid manure. The review found that housing systems with deep litter emit more NH3 than tied stalls. This is likely to be because the emitting surface area in a tied stall is smaller. Laying hens emit more NH3 than broilers and reduced-emission housing systems for poultry, including the aviary system, can reduce NH3 emissions by between 50\% and 80\%. The greatest N2O-N emissions from buildings housing livestock were also from deep litter systems, but the amount of N2O-N was smaller than that of NH3-N by a factor of 15. Air exchange and temperature increase induced by aerobic decomposition during manure storage may greatly increase NH3 emission. Emissions of 0.25\textendash 0.30 of the total-N have been recorded from pig and cattle manure heaps undergoing aerobic decomposition. Increased density of manure during storage significantly decreased temperatures in manure heaps. Storing solid manures at high density also reduces air exchange which with the low temperature limits the formation and transfer of NH3 to the surface layers of the heap, reducing emissions. Most N2O emission estimates from cattle and pig manure have been between 0.001 and 0.009 of total-N. Emission of N2O from poultry manure tends to be small. Average unabated NH3 emissions following application of manure were 0.79, 0.63 and 0.40 of total ammoniacal-N (TAN) from cattle, pig and poultry manure respectively. The smaller emission from poultry manure is expected as hydrolysis of uric acid to urea may take many months and is often incomplete even after application, hence limiting the potential for NH3 emission. Manure incorporation within 4 h after application reduced emission on average by 32\%, 92\% and 85\% for cattle, pig and poultry manure respectively. Reductions following incorporation within 24 h or more after application were 20\%, 56\% and 50\% for cattle, pigs and poultry, respectively. Incorporation by disc or harrow reduced NH3 emissions less than incorporation by plough. Emissions of N2O following the application of cattle manure were 0.12 of TAN without incorporation after application and 0.073 TAN with incorporation after application. Conversely, emissions following application of pig and poultry manures were 0.003 and 0.001 TAN respectively without and 0.035 and 0.089 TAN respectively with incorporation after application.},

  abstract = {Livestock farming is the world's largest land use sector and utilizes around 60\% of the global biomass harvest. Over the coming decades, climate change will affect the natural resource base of livestock production, especially the productivity of rangeland and feed crops. Based on a comprehensive impact modeling chain, we assess implications of different climate projections for agricultural production costs and land use change and explore the effectiveness of livestock system transitions as an adaptation strategy. Simulated climate impacts on crop yields and rangeland productivity generate adaptation costs amounting to 3\% of total agricultural production costs in 2045 (i.e. 145 billion US\$). Shifts in livestock production towards mixed crop-livestock systems represent a resource- and cost-efficient adaptation option, reducing agricultural adaptation costs to 0.3\% of total production costs and simultaneously abating deforestation by about 76 million ha globally. The relatively positive climate impacts on grass yields compared with crop yields favor grazing systems inter alia in South Asia and North America. Incomplete transitions in production systems already have a strong adaptive and cost reducing effect: a 50\% shift to mixed systems lowers agricultural adaptation costs to 0.8\%. General responses of production costs to system transitions are robust across different global climate and crop models as well as regarding assumptions on CO2 fertilization, but simulated values show a large variation. In the face of these uncertainties, public policy support for transforming livestock production systems provides an important lever to improve agricultural resource management and lower adaptation costs, possibly even contributing to emission reduction.},

With 80\% of agricultural land dedicated to livestock production, the sector is an important lever to attenuate land requirements for food production and carbon emissions from land use change. In this study, we quantify impacts of changing human diets and livestock productivity on land dynamics and depletion of carbon stored in vegetation, litter and soils. Across all investigated productivity pathways, lower consumption of livestock products can substantially reduce deforestation (47\textendash 55\%) and cumulative carbon losses (34\textendash 57\%). On the supply side, already minor productivity growth in extensive livestock production systems leads to substantial CO2 emission abatement, but the emission saving potential of productivity gains in intensive systems is limited, also involving trade-offs with soil carbon stocks. If accounting for uncertainties related to future trade restrictions, crop yields and pasture productivity, the range of projected carbon savings from changing diets increases to 23\textendash 78\%. Highest abatement of carbon emissions (63\textendash 78\%) can be achieved if reduced consumption of animal-based products is combined with sustained investments into productivity increases in plant production. Our analysis emphasizes the importance to integrate demand- and supply-side oriented mitigation strategies and to combine efforts in the crop and livestock sector to enable synergies for climate protection.},

  abstract = {This thesis is directed towards the issue of the long-term demand and supply of biomass for food, energy and materials. In the coming decades, the global requirements for biomass for such services are likely to increase substantially. Therefore, improved knowledge of options for mitigating the long-term production requirements and the associated effects on the Earth system is essential. {$<$}p /{$>$}The thesis gives a thorough survey of the current flows of biomass in the food system. This survey was carried out by means of a physical model which was developed as part of the work. For eight world regions, the model is used to calculate the necessary production of crops and other phytomass from a prescribed end-use of food, efficiency in food production and processing, as well as use of by-products and residues. The model includes all major categories of phytomass used in the food system, depicts all flows and processes on a mass and energy balance basis, and contains detailed descriptions of the production and use of all major by-products and residues generated within the system. {$<$}p /{$>$}The global appropriation of terrestrial phytomass production induced by the food system was estimated to some 13 Pg dry matter per year in 1992-94. Of this phytomass, about 0.97 Pg, or 7.5 percent, ended up as food commodities eaten. Animal food systems accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total appropriation of phytomass, whereas their contribution to the human diet was about one-tenth. Use of by-products and residues as feed, and for other purposes within the food system, was estimated to about 1.8 Pg dry matter, or 14 percent of the total phytomass appropriation. {$<$}p /{$>$}The results also show large differences in efficiency for animal food systems, between regions as well as between separate commodities. The feed conversion efficiencies of cattle meat systems were estimated to about 2 percent in industrial regions, and around 0.5 percent in most non-industrial regions (on gross energy basis). For pig and poultry systems, feed conversion efficiencies were roughly a factor of ten higher. The differences suggest that there is a substantial scope for mitigating the long-term production demand for crops and other phytomass by increases in efficiency and changes in dietary preferences.},

Several studies indicate that cover crops could replace anthropogenic inputs and enhance crop productivity. However, so far, it is unclear if cover crop effects vary between different cropping systems, and direct comparisons among major arable production systems are rare. Here we compared the short-term effects of various cover crops on crop yield, nitrogen uptake, and weed infestation in four arable production systems (conventional cropping with intensive tillage and no-tillage; organic cropping with intensive tillage and reduced tillage). We hypothesized that cover cropping effects increase with decreasing management intensity. Our study demonstrated that cover crop effects on crop yield were highest in the organic system with reduced tillage (+24\%), intermediate in the organic system with tillage (+13\%) and in the conventional system with no tillage (+8\%) and lowest in the conventional system with tillage (+2\%). Our results indicate that cover crops are essential to maintaining a certain yield level when soil tillage intensity is reduced (e.g. under conservation agriculture), or when production is converted to organic agriculture. Thus, the inclusion of cover crops provides additional opportunities to increase the yield of lower intensity production systems and contribute to ecological intensification.},

These estimates were combined for a single estimate of net carbon exchange and spatially distributed to 0.05\textdegree{} resolution using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite land cover data. Global crop NPP in 2011 was estimated at 5.25\,{$\pm$}\,0.46\,Pg\,C\,yr-1, of which 2.05\,{$\pm$}\,0.05\,Pg\,C\,yr-1 was harvested and 0.54\,Pg\,C\,yr-1 was collected from crop residues for livestock fodder.

Livestock grazed an estimated 1.27\,Pg\,C\,yr-1 in 2011, which constituted 52.4\% of total feed intake. Global human food intake was 0.57\,{$\pm$}\,0.03\,Pg\,C\,yr-1 in 2011, the majority of which was respired as CO2. Completed global cropland carbon budgets accounted for the ultimate use of approximately 80\% of harvested biomass. The spatial distribution of these fluxes may be used for global carbon monitoring, estimation of regional uncertainty, and for use as input to Earth system models.},

  abstract = {To feed the world's growing population, more food needs to be produced using currently available cropland. In addition to yield increase, increasing cropping intensity may provide another promising opportunity to boost global crop production. However, spatially explicit information on the cropping intensity gap (CIG) of current global croplands is lacking. Here, we developed the first spatially explicit approach to measure the global CIG, which represents the difference between the potential and actual cropping intensity. Results indicate that the global average CIG around the year 2010 was 0.48 and 0.17 for the temperature- and temperature/precipitation-limited scenarios, respectively. Surprisingly, global harvest areas can be expanded by another 7.36 million  km2 and 2.71 million km2 (37.55\% and 13.83\% of current global cropland) under the two scenarios, respectively. This will largely compensate the future global cropland loss due to increasing urbanization and industrialization. Latin America has the largest potential to expand its harvest area by closing the CIGs, followed by Asia. Some countries in Africa have a large CIG, meaning that some additional harvests can potentially be achieved. Our analysis suggests that reducing the CIG would provide a potential strategy to increase global food production without cropland expansion, thus also helping achieve other Sustainable Development Goals such as biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {It is widely recommended that crop straw be returned to croplands to maintain or increase soil carbon (C) storage in arable soils. However, because C and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycles are closely coupled, straw return may also affect soil reactive N (Nr) losses, but these effects remain uncertain, especially in terms of the interactions between soil C sequestration and Nr losses under straw addition. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis using 363 publications to assess the overall effects of straw return on soil Nr losses, C sequestration and crop productivity in agroecosystems. Our results show that on average, compared to mineral N fertilization, straw return with same amount of mineral N fertilizer significantly increased soil organic C (SOC) content (14.9\%), crop yield (5.1\%), and crop N uptake (10.9\%). Moreover, Nr losses in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from rice paddies (17.3\%), N leaching (8.7\%), and runoff (25.6\%) were significantly reduced, mainly due to enhanced microbial N immobilization. However, N2O emissions from upland fields (21.5\%) and ammonia (NH3) emissions (17.0\%) significantly increased following straw return, mainly due to the stimulation of nitrification/denitrification and soil urease activity. The increase in NH3 and N2O emissions was significantly and negatively correlated with straw C/N ratio and soil clay content. Regarding the interactions between C sequestration and Nr losses, the increase in SOC content following straw return was significantly and positively correlated with the decrease in N leaching and runoff. However, at a global scale, straw return increased net Nr losses from both rice and upland fields due to a greater stimulation of NH3 emissions than the reduction in N leaching and runoff. The trade-offs between increased net Nr losses and soil C sequestration highlight the importance of reasonably managing straw return to soils to limit NH3 emissions without decreasing associated C sequestration potential.},

However, the underlying mechanism of biochar (BC) priming relative to conventional biowaste (BW) amendments remains uncertain. Here, we used a stable carbon isotope ({$\delta$}13C) approach to estimate the possible biochar effects on native soil C-mineralization compared with various BW additions and potential carbon sequestration. The results show that immediately after application, BC suppresses and then increases C-mineralization, causing a loss of 0.14\textendash 7.17~mg-CO2\textendash C~g-1-C compared to the control (0.24\textendash 1.86~mg-CO2\textendash C~g-1-C) over 1\textendash 120~days. Negative priming was observed for BC compared to various BW amendments (-10.22 to -23.56~mg-CO2\textendash C~g-1-soil-C); however, it was trivially positive relative to that of the control (8.64~mg-CO2\textendash C~g-1-soil-C). Furthermore, according to the residual carbon and {$\delta$}13C signature of postexperimental soil carbon, BC-C significantly increased (P~{$<~$}0.05) the soil carbon stock by carbon sequestration in soil compared with various biowaste amendments. The results of cumulative CO2\textendash C emissions, relative priming effects, and carbon storage indicate that BC reduces C-mineralization, resulting in greater C-sequestration compared with other BW amendments, and the magnitude of this effect initially increases and then decreases and stabilizes over time, possibly due to the presence of recalcitrant-C (4.92~mg-C~g-1-soil) in BC, the reduced microbial activity, and the sorption of labile organic carbon (OC) onto BC particles.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Given the important role of nitrogen input from livestock systems in terrestrial nutrient cycles and the atmospheric chemical composition, it is vital to have a robust estimation of the magnitude and spatiotemporal variation in manure nitrogen production and its application to cropland across the globe. In this study, we used the dataset from the Global Livestock Impact Mapping System (GLIMS) in conjunction with country-specific annual livestock populations to reconstruct the manure nitrogen production during 1860\textendash 2014. The estimated manure nitrogen production increased from 21.4TgNyr\textsuperscript{-1} in 1860 to 131.0TgNyr\textsuperscript{-1} in 2014 with a significant annual increasing trend (0.7TgNyr\textsuperscript{-1}, \emph{p}\&lt; 0.01). Changes in manure nitrogen production exhibited high spatial variability and concentrated in several hotspots (e.g., Western Europe, India, northeastern China, and southeastern Australia) across the globe over the study period. In the 1860s, the northern midlatitude region was the largest manure producer, accounting for {$\sim$} 52\% of the global total, while low-latitude regions became the largest share ({$\sim$}48\%) in the most recent 5 years (2010\textendash 2014). Among all the continents, Asia accounted for over one-fourth of the global manure production during 1860\textendash 2014. Cattle dominated the manure nitrogen production and contributed {$\sim$} 44\% of the total manure nitrogen production in 2014, followed by goats, sheep, swine, and chickens. The manure nitrogen application to cropland accounts for less than one-fifth of the total manure nitrogen production over the study period. The 5arcmin gridded global dataset of manure nitrogen production generated from this study could be used as an input for global or regional land surface and ecosystem models to evaluate the impacts of manure nitrogen on key biogeochemical processes and water quality. To ensure food security and environmental sustainability, it is necessary to implement proper manure management practices on cropland across the globe.

  abstract = {The role of soil organic carbon in global carbon cycles is receiving increasing attention both as a potentially large and uncertain source of CO2 emissions in response to predicted global temperature rises, and as a natural sink for carbon able to reduce atmospheric CO2. There is general agreement that the technical potential for sequestration of carbon in soil is significant, and some consensus on the magnitude of that potential. Croplands worldwide could sequester between 0.90 and 1.85 Pg C/yr, i.e. 26-53\% of the target of the "4p1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate". The importance of intensively cultivated regions such as North America, Europe, India and intensively cultivated areas in Africa, such as Ethiopia, is highlighted. Soil carbon sequestration and the conservation of existing soil carbon stocks, given its multiple benefits including improved food production, is an important mitigation pathway to achieve the less than 2 degrees C global target of the Paris Climate Agreement.},
