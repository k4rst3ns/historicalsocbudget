# Content section with citations

See the [R Markdown docs for bibliographies and citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

Copernicus supports biblatex and a sample bibliography is in file `sample.bib`.
Read [], and [see ].

# Content section with R code chunks

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sum <- 1 + 41
```

You should always use `echo = FALSE` on R Markdown code blocks as they add formatting and styling not desired by Copernicus.
The hidden workflow results in `r sum`.

You can add verbatim code snippets without extra styles by using ` ``` ` without additional instructions.

```
sum <- 1 + 41
```

# Content section with list

If you want to insert a list, you must

- leave

- empty lines

- between each list item
