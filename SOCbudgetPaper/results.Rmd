# Results

We present simulation results of the SOC budget of the period from 1975 to 2010 mainly focusing on cropland areas. Detailed total global and regional results of the state of the worlds SOC in comparison to other estimates can be found in the supplement.

## SOC distribution and depletion
Figure 

```{r caption_SOCmaps, echo=FALSE}
caption_SOCmaps <- "(a): Distribution of total global SOC stocks on cropland shows high carbon stocks in high yielding areas. (b): The SOC debt is decreasing over time, meaning net SOC gains on global croplands over the last decades (despite ongoing cropland expansion). (c)+(d): Absolute (c) and relative (d) SOC stocks compared to a potential natural state showing different hot spots of SOC dynamics. Whereas the absolute losses might be in temperate dry regions, relative losses are more prominent in tropical moist areas."

## global agricultural carbon flows and stocks


```{r caption_FlowFig, echo=FALSE}
caption_FlowFig <- "Global carbon flows (small numbers) and stocks (bold numbers) within the agricultural system for the year 2010 (in MtC): Most important carbon sources on cropland are crop residues. Note the two numbers on carbon inputs to soil denote carbon applied to the field and carbon entering the soil (difference is decomposted before official counting as soil)."
```

```


## comparison of stock changes factors 

```{r caption_SCFtable, echo=FALSE}
caption_SCFtable <- "$F^{SOC}$ in comparison to IPCC Tier 1 default factors: Stock change factors are in good agreement with the default values of the IPCC in general. For the tropical regions the assumptions changed notablly from the guidelines in 2006 to the update in 2019. leaving our results in very good agreement with the old default assumptions. Default assumption are given under the assumption of medium input systems, which, considering the yield gap in mainly developing regions in the tropics, might be an overestimation and decrease $F^{SOC}$ by additional 5-8 percent. Also: modelled $F^{SOC}$ have increased for all climates over time ."
