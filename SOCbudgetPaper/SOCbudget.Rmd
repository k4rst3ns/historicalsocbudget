  \section{Figures and tables in appendices}
  \subsection{Option 1}
  If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
  They will be correctly named automatically.
  \subsection{Option 2}
  If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
  
  `\appendixfigures` needs to be added in front of appendix figures
  `\appendixtables` needs to be added in front of appendix tables
  
  Please add `\clearpage` between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
  Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:
  To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:
