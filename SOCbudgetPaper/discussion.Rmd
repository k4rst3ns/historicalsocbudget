### TWO-COLUMN FIGURES

You can also include a larger figure.

## TABLES

You can ad \LaTeX table in an R Markdown document to meet the template requirements.

### ONE-COLUMN TABLE

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{TEXT}
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
\tophline

a & b & c \\
\middlehline
1 & 2 & 3 \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\belowtable{Table Footnotes}
\end{table}

### TWO-COLUMN TABLE

\begin{table*}[t]
\caption{TEXT}
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
\tophline

a & b & c \\
\middlehline
1 & 2 & 3 \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}

## MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS

All papers typeset by Copernicus Publications follow the math typesetting regulations given by the IUPAC Green Book (IUPAC: Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry, 2nd Edn., Blackwell Science, available at: http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf, 1993).

Physical quantities/variables are typeset in italic font (t for time, T for Temperature)

Indices which are not defined are typeset in italic font (x, y, z, a, b, c)

Items/objects which are defined are typeset in roman font (Car A, Car B)

Descriptions/specifications which are defined by itself are typeset in roman font (abs, rel, ref, tot, net, ice)

Abbreviations from 2 letters are typeset in roman font (RH, LAI)

Vectors are identified in bold italic font using \vec{x}

Matrices are identified in bold roman font

Multiplication signs are typeset using the LaTeX commands `\times` (for vector products, grids, and exponential notations) or `\cdot`

The character * should not be applied as mutliplication sign

## ALGORITHM
  
  If you want to use algorithms, you can either enable the required packages in the header (the default, see `algorithms: true`), or make sure yourself that the \LaTeX packages `algorithms` and `algorithmicx` are installed so that `algorithm.sty` respectively `algorithmic.sty` can be loaded by the Copernicus template.
Copernicus staff will remove all undesirable packages from your LaTeX source code, so please stick to using the header option, which only adds the two acceptable packages.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Algorithm Caption}
\label{a1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $i\gets 10$
  \IF {$i\geq 5$} 
\STATE $i\gets i-1$
  \ELSE
\IF {$i\leq 3$}
\STATE $i\gets i+2$
  \ENDIF
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
