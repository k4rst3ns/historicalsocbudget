## Including agricultural management data changes the sign of the trend

This study provides an analysis of historic SOC stock changes on cropland. We determine the SOC trends on cropland compared to a counterfactual scenario with a world under natural vegetation under identical historical climatic conditions ($SOC_{natveg}$). Our results show, that human activity lead to cumulative SOC emission of around 37 GtC in 2010. Whereas recent modeling estimates of global SOC emissions indicate an ongoing increase of SOC emissions ([@pugh_simulated_2015], [@sanderman_soil_2017]), our study indicates that the global SOC gap is slowly closing due to improved management.

According to [@sanderman_soil_2017] cumulative SOC emissions since the beginning of human cropping activities have been at around 37 GtC for the first 30 cm of the soil with half of it attributed to grazing. Our estimate of 37 GtC in 2010 for cropland emissions only is twice as high as [@sanderman_soil_2017] estimations. However, there are large uncertainties in modeling SOC at the global scale, and the [@sanderman_soil_2017] results have been pointed out as potentially conservatively low compared with experimental results, leaving our results in an aceptable range.

Furthermore, [@sanderman_soil_2017] modeled historical trends based on agricultural land expansion without considering SOC variations due to different management systems at all. [@pugh_simulated_2015] considered management effects like tillage and residue recycling in a static way, but neither changes over time nor alignment to observed historical data like yields-levels or no-tillage areas were taken into account. The study moreover concludes that crop productivity gains (increasing yield levels by 18%) do not lead to a substantial decrease in SOC emissions, accounting for only less than 1% change in SOC emissions.

Our study for the first time uses a dynamic management dataset as driver for SOC dynamics. We show that the moderate global cropland expansion of around 11% between 1974 and 2010 and the resulting depletion of SOC stocks in converted cropland has been out weighted by improved agricultural yields and practices. This challenges [@pugh_simulated_2015] findings of only small effects due to improved practices.

Moreover, our sensitivity analysis indicates that (1) recycled residue biomass increases driven by higher yields as well as higher recycling rates play the most important role, followed by (2) improved manure recycling (e.g. due to improved animal waste management systems) and (3) the adoption of no tillage practices.

modeling management effects on the global scale comes however with parametric and structural uncertainties. As pointed out by [@keel_large_2017] and [@smith_how_2020], carbon input calculations are highly sensitive to the choice of allometric functions determining below and above ground residue estimates from harvested quantities. [@keel_large_2017] question whether below ground residues might increase with a fixed root:shoot ratio rather than being independent of productivity gains. Moreover, the study pointed out that plant breeding shifts allometries which might not be reflected in outdated data sources. Following this line of argumentation, SOC results calculated in this study may overestimate actual SOC stocks due to an overestimation in residue biomass, for which the ratio compared to the harvested organ is normally reduced due to breeding. However, with an evaluation of management effects (see below), there is no indication for a systematic overrating of residue biomass. Rather, it is more likely that we are still missing carbon inputs to the soil.

## Modeled management effect in line with default IPCC assumptions

To validate our modeled SOC stocks and stock changes under management, we compare our results to default IPCC stock changes factors (@ipcc_2006_2006, @ipcc_2019_2019) which are based on measurement data for croplands (see \@ref(tab:SCFtable)). To allow for comparison, we aggregate our stock change factors to the four IPCC climate zones.

```{r captionSCFtable, echo=FALSE}
captionSCFtable <- "This table shows different estimates of stock change factors $F_{SCF}$, defined as the SOC stock of managed croplands relative to the counterfactual SOC stock of undisturbed natural vegetation. We compare average values for four IPCC climate zone classifications. IPCC 2006 and 2019 default factors (medium input) as well as altered factors for low input of organic matter without any other subsystem consideration are compared to results for 1990 and 2010 of this study (SOC budget)."
```

```{r SCFtable, out.width = "16cm", fig.cap = captionSCFtable, echo=FALSE}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics("../ResultNotebooks/Output/Images/TableSCF_comparison.png")
```

Our estimates correspond very well to the default stock-change factors used for the tier 1 estimation of IPCC, 2006. For the tropical regions the assumptions changed notably from the guidelines in 2006 to the update in 2019, leaving our results too low in comparison with IPCC, 2019. Considering yield gaps in mainly developing regions in the tropics the default assumption of medium input systems might be an overestimation of actual SOC state. The additional effect of considering low inputs of biomass in tropical regions can however not explain the full mismatch to IPCC 2019 values but account for 14-21% of it.

With regard to the time trend, our study shows the substantial impact of changing management factors on the development of $F_{SCF}$.

## SOC stocks inline with literature

The world's SOC stock and its changes are highly uncertain (cite), which is seen in the wide range of global SOC stock estimates (see \@ref(tab:SOCtable)).

```{r captionSOCtable, echo=FALSE}
captionSOCtable <- "modeled as well as data based estimation for global SOC stock in GtC for the first 30 cm of soil aggregated over all land area. Note that SoilGrids, GSOC and WISE do not consider changes over time and rely on soil profile data gather over a long period of time, which makes it hard to pinpoint a specific year for these SOC estimations. In this context they will be compared to modeled data (LPJmL4, this study) for the year 2010."
```

```{r SOCtable, out.width = "8cm", fig.cap = captionSOCtable, echo=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics("../ResultNotebooks/Output/Images/glo_comparisonfigure.png")
```

The global estimates of SOC stock from this study are on the lower end compared to other modeled results or more data driven estimates. Looking at regional results \@ref(append:regcompare), our estimates turn out to be in good agreement for most regions, with the largest deviations for boreal areas. Considering that the model was parametrized for croplands, these mismatches are not suprising as the temperature effects on decomposition are fundamentally different for permafrost soils. To avoid that this bias influences our results, our study focuses exclusively on cropland soils, excluding most of the boreal zone. Moreover, when focussing on SOC changes on cropland, pristine natural vegetated areas without human land management under the same historic climatic conditions cancel out in the calculation of SOC emissions.

Our estimates for total SOC stocks of the world, as well as our SOC initialization, are dominated by the representation of natural lands and pastures, which are however only estimated in a basic manner. For example, we do not have a differentiated parametrization of nitrogen and lignin content of litterfall for woody and grass type biomes. This leaves carbon inputs and decay behavior for natural land and pastures rather uncertain. The absolute values of stocks and emissions from land-use change therefore have to be used with caution. Especially in less forested areas the natural land representation higher uncertainty may arise from the parametrization assumptions of natural litterfall.

Nevertheless, total SOC stocks are in a reasonable range and results for SOC stock changes in relative or absolute numbers are not altered by pristine vegetated areas at all. The SOC gap from changed management is only affected by the natural vegetation representation in the case of land use transitions. In this case, former natural land SOC stocks decline. However, as pointed out before, due to low cropland expansion rates, land use change-related SOC declines are outweighed by the general trend of increasing SOC stocks on existing cropland due to management improvements.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis for a wide range of possible parameter combinations for lignin and nitrogen parametrization of natural litterfall, which tend to change the global SOC stock substantially for different choices
(see appendix). This shows that the general trend of decreasing SOC gap is not altered even under very high estimates for natural SOC stocks.

## Important shortcomings --> might be added as well

The **initialization of SOC stocks** in 1960 is assumed to be in steady state considering the land use pattern and management effects of the initialization year followed by a run-in period of 15 years, till the analysis of the results start. That is inline with IPCC guidelines calling for a run-in period of 5-20 years. However, the results are heavily influenced by it as \@ref(append:initcompare) suggested. Not only the level of the SOC gap is shifted, also the declining trend is much smaller or even not visible at all anymore. For the artificial assumption of starting with potential natural vegetation in 1961 the SOC gap is fluctuating around 10 GtC for the period 1975--2010. For the more moderate assumption, that half of the transition towards the steady-state under land use has already appeared in 1960, the SOC gap is around 23 GtC in 2010. The relative declining trend for the SOC gap between 1975 and 2010 (-12%) is however almost the same as for our historic estimation (-14%). According to LUH [@hurtt_harmonization_2020] cropland area has increased over 62% since 1900 leaving our choice of initialization values too low, since reaching a new steady-state can take decades or even centuries. Having no yield or management data available before our initialization year leaves us with imperfect initialization knowledge, where our initialization choice is probably closer to real world values than starting from a natural vegetated steady-state.

Following the IPCC guidelines this study has limited its focus to the **first 30 cm of the soil profile**. In this regard several aspects are over simplified within our approach. Firstly, distribution of carbon inputs into different soil layers are neglected and all carbon inputs are allocated to the topsoil. This particularly overestimates SOC stocks in the first 30 cm of soil below deeper rooting vegetation, which is certainly the case for most of the woody natural vegetated areas. Consequently, our SOC loss estimates are too high.
Secondly changes to the subsoil due to tillage are neglected, which might be important to noticed, hence studies (see Don on tillage) have shown, the subsoil to be a game changer in evaluating total SOC losses or gains for no-tillage systems. It has been argued that for intensively tilled soils, subsoil SOC is increasing due to the import of carbon rich topsoil to deeper soil layers. Following this arguments SOC stocks in croplands might even be underestimated.

Carbon displacement via **leaching and erosion** is neglected in this study. As pointed out by several studies (cite), the final fate of leached or eroded carbon is uncertain. Whereas for soil quality analysis SOC displacement might play an important role, in this budget approach focusing especially on SOC emissions, displaced but not emitted SOC can be treated as SOC stayed on croplands.
