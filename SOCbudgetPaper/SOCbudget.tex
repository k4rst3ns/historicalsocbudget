\begin{abstract}
SOC one of larges c sinks on earth (3 times larger biospehre pool). Agricultural management leads to a depletion of soil organic crabon. However
this depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools are so far not well represented in global assessments of historic carbon emissions. While SOC
models often represent well the biochemical processes that lead to the accumulation and decay of SOC, the management decisions driving these
biophysical processes are still little investigated.
Here we create a spatial explicit data set for crop residue and manure management on cropland based on global historic production (FAOSTAT) and
land-use (LUH2) data and combine it with the IPCC Tier 2 approach to create a half-degree resolution soil organic carbon budget on mineral soils.
We estimate that due to arable farming soils have lost over (?) GtOC of which (??) GtOC have been released within the period 1990-2010.
Tier 2 IPCC methodolgy estimates higher soil organic carbon losses than Tier 1 methods, which may origin from \ldots{} . We also find that SOC is very
sensity to management decision such as residue recycling indicating the nessessity to incorporated better management data in soil models.

\subsection{Carbon Stocks following (new) Tier 2 method (50)}\label{sec:carbonbudget}}

We calculate annual land use type specific soil organic carbon stocks for cropland, pastures and natural vegetation on half-degree resolution for the period of 1965 to 2010 based on the following three steps: (1) Calculating the land use (sub-)type specific steady-states and decay rates for SOC stocks given the current biophysical, climatic and agronomic conditions, (2) accounting for land conversation effects by transferring SOC between land use types and (3) updating SOC stocks based on the previous stock, the steady-state and the decay rate.

\hypertarget{steady-state-soc-stocks-and-decay-rates}{%
\subsubsection{Steady-state SOC stocks and decay rates}\label{steady-state-soc-stocks-and-decay-rates}}

In a simple first order kinetic approach the steady-state soil organic carbon stocks \(SOC^{eq}\) are given by
\begin{equation}
SOC^{eq} =\frac{C^{\textrm{in}}}{k}
\label{eq:inoutflow}
\end{equation}
with \(C^{\textrm{in}}\) being carbon inputs to the soil and \(k\) denoting the soil organic carbon decay rate. We use for our calculations the steady-state method of the refinement of the IPCC guidelines vol.~4 (\citet{ipcc_2019_2019}) for mineral soils, which assume three soil carbon sub-pools (active, slow and passive) and entangled dynamics between them. Carbon inflow to each sub-pool (see \ref{sec:carboninputs}) and decay rates (see \ref{sec:tier2}) of each sub-pool are still the key components to determining steady-state SOC stocks.

\hypertarget{sec:carboninputs}{%
\subsubsection{Carbon Inputs to the Soil}\label{sec:carboninputs}}

We account for different carbon inputs sources depending on the land use type (see table \ref{tab:datasourceinputs}). Following the IPCC methodology carbon inputs are disaggregated into different structural components depending on their lignin and nitrogen content (see @ref(ipcc\_2019\_2019)). For each structural components the sum over all carbon inputs sources is allocated to the respective SOC sub-pools. This implies that not only the amount of carbon, but also their structural composition is determining the effective inflow. Data sources for all considered carbon inputs as well as for lignin and nitrogen content can be found in table \ref{tab:datasourceinputs}.

\hypertarget{sec:tier2}{%
\subsubsection{Soil Organic Carbon decay (300)}\label{sec:tier2}}

Decay rates are influenced by climatic conditions, biophysical and biochemical soil properties as well as management factors that vary over time (t) and space (i). Following the steady-state method of the refinement of the IPCC guidelines vol.~4 (\citet{ipcc_2019_2019}) for mineral soils we consider temperature (temp), water (wat), sand fraction (sf) and tillage (till) effects to spatially disaggregate default global decay rates. Since the three different SOC sub-pools represent different SOC characteristics, the global decay rates and the associated drivers differ. Thus \(k_{sub}\) is given by

\begin{equation}
k_{sub,t,i} = \quad k_{sub} \quad \cdot temp_{t,i} \quad \cdot wat_{t,i} \quad \underbrace{\cdot till_{t,i} \quad \overbrace{\cdot sf_{t,i}.}^\text{only for sub = active}}_{\text{for sub = (active,slow)}}
\label{eq:decayrates}
\end{equation}

For cropland we performed an assessment of tillage types and irrigation conditions, whereas on pastures and natural vegetation, we assume rainfed and non-tilled conditions. Data sources as well as considered effects for each land use types are shown in table \ref{tab:datasourcedecay}. To account for variations of decay rates within grid cells based on different tillage and irrigation regimes, average rates based on area shares are calculated.

\hypertarget{soc-transfer-between-land-use-types}{%
\subsubsection{SOC transfer between land use types}\label{soc-transfer-between-land-use-types}}

We calculate SOC stocks based on the area shares of land use types (lut) within the half-degree grid cells (i). If land is converted from one land use type into another, a respective share of the SOC stocks have to be reallocated as well. We account for land conversion at the beginning of each time step \(t\) by calculating a preliminary stock \(SOC_{lut,t*}\) via

\begin{equation}
SOC_{lut,t*} = SOC_{lut,t-1} - \frac{SOC_{lut,t-1}}{A_{lut,t-1}} \cdot  AR_{lut,t} + \frac{SOC_{!lut,t-1}}{A_{!lut,t-1}} \cdot  AE_{lut,t} \qquad \forall sub, i  
\label{eq:ctransfer}
\end{equation}

with \(A\) being the area, \(AR\) the area reduction and \(AE\) the area expansion for a given land use type \(lut\). Note that \(!lut\) denotes the sum over all other land use types, which decreases in the specific time step \(t\). Data sources and methodology on land use states and changes are descripted in \ref{sec:landuse}.

\hypertarget{total-soc-stocks}{%
\subsubsection{Total SOC stocks}\label{total-soc-stocks}}

Carbon stocks \(SOC\) for each sub-pool (sub) converge towards the calculate steady-state stock \(SOC^{eq}\) for each land-use types (lut), each sub-pool (sub) and each annual time step (t) as represented in equation \eqref{eq:steadystate}.

\begin{equation}
SOC_{t} = SOC_{t-1} + (SOC^{eq}_{t} - SOC_{t-1}) \cdot k_{t} \cdot \Delta t \qquad \forall lut, sub, i.
\label{eq:steadystate}
\end{equation}

The global SOC stock for each time step can than be calculated via

\begin{equation}
SOC_{t} = \sum_{i} \underbrace{\sum_{lut} \overbrace{\sum_{sub} SOC_{lut, sub, t, i}.}^{\text{land use type specific SOC stock within a grid cell}}}_{\text{total SOC stock within a grid cell}}
\label{eq:totalstock}
