# Method (50)

<!-- Soil carbon dynamics are modeled using a yearly based SOC model and carbon input and management data. -->

## Carbon Budget (50)

Based on the IPCC guidelines [@IPCC2019] for soil organic carbon stocks, we combining approaches to estimate SOC stocks by weighting inflows via dead plant material (see \@ref(sec:carboninputs)) against outflows through SOC decay (see \@ref(sec:tier2)). Carbon displacement via leaching and erosion is neglected for this budget. The simple Tier 1 method based on stock change factors is used to cross validated results \@ref(sec:tier1) 

### Carbon Inputs to the Soil {#sec:carboninputs}

Carbon inputs estimations are based on the land use type. Whereas cropland inputs are mainly formed by disaggregated country statistics on residue, dead below ground and cover crop biomass, pasture and natural vegetation inputs are estimate via modelled annual litterfall rates. For the former we use several data sets and rule based approaches to reflect management decisions, which are specified in \@ref(sec:agrimanagement). The later are based on LPJmL4 estimations for natural vegetation (see Sybilles paper) and grassland (see Susannes Paper).  

### Soil Carbon turnover following (new) Tier 2 method (300) {#sec:tier2}




Yearly turnover between three different SOC pools for the topsoil is model using global parameters.

### Soil Carbon turnover following Tier 1 (150) {#sec:tier1}

Following the tier 1 approach of the IPCC guidelines 2006, stocks are estimated via stock change factors reflecting , in- and outflows are not calculated explicitly

Stock changes are calculated using simple change factors on the SOC pools for the topsoil.




## Agricultural management	(50) {#sec:agrimanagement}
We combine data sets to estimate agricultural flows and management decisions on cropland.

### Landuse and Landuse Change (150)
We use LUH2v2 data for major Landuse types and their transition and fit cropspecific areas to country scale FAO data. 

### Crop Production and Residues	(300)
FAO Production values are combined with Feed estimations from [Isabelles Paper] and rule based demand shares. LPJmL yield and LUH landuse patterns are used to scale down to half-degree.

### Livestock Distribution and Manure Excretion	(300)
Based on [Gridded Livestock of the world] we use rule based asumption to estimate livestock and manure distribution on the globe. Animal waste system shares are used as is [Bodirsky].

### Irrigation (100)
Simple growing period calculations together with irrigation shares of LUH2v2 are use to estimate water effects on decay rates.

### Tillage (100)
Tillage data sets of [Vera, others] together with rules are used to drive tillage effect on decay rates.
