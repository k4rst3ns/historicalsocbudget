## Carbon Stocks following (new) Tier 2 method (50) {#sec:carbonbudget}

We calculate annual land use type specific soil organic carbon stocks for cropland, pastures and natural vegetation on half-degree resolution for the period of 1965 to 2010 based on the following three steps: (1) Calculating the land use (sub-)type specific steady-states and decay rates for SOC stocks given the current biophysical, climatic and agronomic conditions, (2) accounting for land conversation effects by transferring SOC between land use types and (3) updating SOC stocks based on the previous stock, the steady-state and the decay rate. 

### Steady-state SOC stocks and decay rates

In a simple first order kinetic approach the steady-state soil organic carbon stocks $SOC^{eq}$ are given by 
\begin{equation}
SOC^{eq} =\frac{C^{\textrm{in}}}{k}
\label{eq:inoutflow}
\end{equation}
with $C^{\textrm{in}}$ being carbon inputs to the soil and $k$ denoting the soil organic carbon decay rate. We use for our calculations the steady-state method of the refinement of the IPCC guidelines vol. 4 (@ipcc_2019_2019) for mineral soils, which assume three soil carbon sub-pools (active, slow and passive) and entangled dynamics between them. Carbon inflow to each sub-pool (see \@ref(sec:carboninputs)) and decay rates (see \@ref(sec:tier2)) of each sub-pool are still the key components to determining steady-state SOC stocks.  

### Carbon Inputs to the Soil {#sec:carboninputs}

We account for different carbon inputs sources depending on the land use type (see table \@ref(tab:datasourceinputs)). Following the IPCC methodology carbon inputs are disaggregated into different structural components depending on their lignin and nitrogen content (see \@ref(ipcc_2019_2019)). For each structural components the sum over all carbon inputs sources is allocated to the respective SOC sub-pools. This implies that not only the amount of carbon, but also their structural composition is determining the effective inflow. Data sources for all considered carbon inputs as well as for lignin and nitrogen content can be found in table \@ref(tab:datasourceinputs).

### Soil Organic Carbon decay (300) {#sec:tier2}

Decay rates are influenced by climatic conditions, biophysical and biochemical soil properties as well as management factors that vary over time (t) and space (i). Following the steady-state method of the refinement of the IPCC guidelines vol. 4 (@ipcc_2019_2019) for mineral soils we consider temperature (temp), water (wat), sand fraction (sf) and tillage (till) effects to spatially disaggregate default global decay rates. Since the three different SOC sub-pools represent different SOC characteristics, the global decay rates and the associated drivers differ. Thus $k_{sub}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& k_{active,t,i}  & = &~ k_{active}  ~ &\cdot~ temp_{t,i} ~ &\cdot~ wat_{t,i} ~ &\cdot~ till_{t,i} ~ & \cdot~ sf_{t,i}\\
& k_{slow,t,i}    & = &~ k_{slow}    ~ &\cdot~ temp_{t,i} ~ &\cdot~ wat_{t,i} ~ &\cdot~ till_{t,i} ~ &\\
& k_{passive,t,i} & = &~ k_{passive} ~ &\cdot~ temp_{t,i} ~ &\cdot~ wat_{t,i} ~ & ~ &
\label{eq:decayrates}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


For cropland we performed an assessment of tillage types and irrigation conditions, whereas on pastures and natural vegetation, we assume rainfed and non-tilled conditions. Data sources as well as considered effects for each land use types are shown in table \@ref(tab:datasourcedecay). To account for variations of decay rates within grid cells based on different tillage and irrigation regimes, average rates based on area shares are calculated.

### SOC transfer between land use types

We calculate SOC stocks based on the area shares of land use types (lut) within the half-degree grid cells (i). If land is converted from one land use type into others (!lut), a respective share of the SOC stocks have to be reallocated as well. We account for land conversion at the beginning of each time step $t$ by calculating a preliminary stock $SOC_{lut,t*}$ via 

\begin{equation}
SOC_{lut,t*} = SOC_{lut,t-1} - \frac{SOC_{lut,t-1}}{A_{lut,t-1}} \cdot  AR_{lut,t} + \frac{SOC_{!lut,t-1}}{A_{!lut,t-1}} \cdot  AE_{lut,t} \qquad \forall sub, i  
\label{eq:ctransfer}
\end{equation}

with $A$ being the area, $AR$ the area reduction and $AE$ the area expansion for a given land use type $lut$. Note that $!lut$ denotes the sum over all other land use types, which decreases in the specific time step $t$. Data sources and methodology on land use states and changes are described in \@ref(sec:landuse).   

### Total SOC stocks

Carbon stocks $SOC$ for each sub-pool (sub) converge towards the calculate steady-state stock $SOC^{eq}$ for each land-use types (lut), each sub-pool (sub) and each annual time step (t) as represented in equation \@ref(eq:steadystate).

\begin{equation}
SOC_{t} = SOC_{t-1} + (SOC^{eq}_{t} - SOC_{t-1}) \cdot k_{t} \cdot 1\unit{a} \qquad \forall lut, sub, i.
\label{eq:steadystate}
\end{equation}

The global SOC stock for each time step can than be calculated via

\begin{equation}
SOC_{t} = \sum_{i} \underbrace{\sum_{lut} \overbrace{\sum_{sub} SOC_{lut, sub, t, i}.}^{\text{$SOC_{lut, t, i}$ - land use type specific SOC stock within cell}}}_{\text{$SOC_{t, i}$ - total SOC stock within cell}}
\label{eq:totalstock}
\end{equation}

## Carbon Budget following Tier 1 (150) {#sec:tier1}

Following the tier 1 approach of the IPCC guidelines vol. 4 (@ipcc_2006_2006), stocks are estimated via stock change factors given by the IPCC for the topsoil (0-30 cm) and based on measurement data and expert choice. The factors  differentiate between different crop and management systems reflecting different dynamics under changed in- and outflows without explicitly tracking these. This method is used additionally to the Tier-2 approach to evaluate model accuracy.

## Agricultural management data on 0.5 degrees	(50) {#sec:agrimanagement}

### Landuse and Landuse Change (150) {#sec:landuse}

Land use patterns are based on the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2, [@LUH2]) data set, which we aggregate from quarter degree to half degree resolution. We disaggregate the five different cropland subcategories of LUH2 into our X crop groups, assuming relative shares for each gridcell based on the country and year specific area shares of FAOSTAT data ([@FAOSTAT]) (see \@ref(appendix:fao2luh2mag)<!--glaube nicht dass du da noch n appendix brauchst-->. For X countries without FAOSTAT data, we fill data gaps by using similar countries as proxies or global averages<!--heisst das die haben HURTT data aber keine FAO daten? woher kriegt dann hurtt die daten?-->. Land use transitions are calculated as area differences of the land use data.

### Crop Production and Residues	(300)
Using half-degree yield data from LPJmL ([@LPJmL4_1]) as well as half-degree cropland patterns (see \@ref(#sec:landuse)) we compile crop functional type specific half-degree production patterns. We calibrate cellular yields with one country-level calibration factor for each crop-group to meet historical FAOSTAT production ([@FAOSTAT]).

Starting from these production estimates of the harvested organs and their respective crop area, we estimate above-ground and below-ground residual biomass using yield-dependent harvest indices and shoot:root ratios as described in ([@bodirsky2012]). We assume that all below ground biomass is left on the fields. A fixed share of the above-ground residues is assumed to be burnt on field, which depends on the per-capita income of the country. For low-income countries according to worldbank definitions (<1000 USD/yr), we assume a ... etc.
ground biomass can be burned or harvested for other purposes such as feeding animals ([@weindl]), fuel or for material uses. We calculate recycle shares by subtracting all residue usages (see [@bodirsky1012, @weindl2019]) from the total above ground biomass.

<!-- Add formular or drawings here? --> 
<!-- if you want, but first finish the rest -->
<!-- Ask benni if it is ok to just cite his paper here and not go into detail, how we distribute the residues --> <!-- Benni: No, explain in detail as it is important for your manuscript and adds credibility to your detailed calcualtions. Also, some assumptions may have changed (e.g. DevelopmentState as function of gdp) -->

To transform dry matter estimates into carbon, we compiled crop functional type specific carbon to dry matter (c:dm) ratios (see appendix table X) [citations] for harvested organs and applied a universal c:dm ratio of 0.44 [citation] for all above and below ground residue biomass.

<!-- Do we have to explain our choice for the crop functional type specific data. Anyway we have to discuss here a bit, because the overall balance is not clear to me. -->

### Pasture production
Using livestock production statistics as well as feed mix assumptions as describted in ([@weindl]) we estimating country specific pasture production. 
<!-- Is this true? Ask Isabelle again. -->

Using the same method as for crop production we disaggregate and calibrate half-degree pasture production pattern.
<!--As for cropland production we used pasture yields from LPJmL and pasture and rangeland patterns to derive half-degree pasture production patterns. Again country specific pasture production is used to calibrated the pattern.-->


### Livestock Distribution and Manure Excretion	(300)
Since their is no native, biophysical indicator to disaggregate country level FAOSTAT livestock production values to half-degree pattern, we use the following rule based assumptions:

* Based on the development state of a country, we devide poultry, egg and monogastric meat production into intensive and extensive systems.

* Extensive production is allocated to urban area share within a country based on the assumption that these animals are held in households, subsistence or small-holder farming systems that are labour rich.  

* Intensive production is distributed within a country using the crop production (excluding 2nd generation bioenergy crops) share, assuming that feed availability is the most driving factor for livestock location.

* We split dairy and ruminated meat production into pasture fed and non-pasture fed fractions based on the aggregated feed mix within a country

<!-- how to spell out that crop is everything else then pasture? -->

* Pasture fed animals are apportioned to half-degree cells according to the pasture production shares of that cell within a country.

* Non-pasture fed animals are distributed again using crop production (excluding 2nd generation bioenergy crops) shares.

<!-- Add formular, drawings or visualisation here? -->

<!-- TILL HERE -->

We calculate excretions using the nitrogen balance of the livestock system ([@bodirsky1012]) by assuming that every feed intake not incoorpared in the slaugher mass, has to excreted. Using C:N ratios (given by [(@ipcc_2019_2019)]) we estimate carbon content  

### Irrigation (100)
Simple growing period calculations together with irrigation shares of LUH2v2 are used (BB: you dont like d's, on't you?) to estimate water effects on decay rates.

### Tillage (100)
Tillage data sets of [Vera, others] together with rules are used to drive tillage effect on decay rates.
