Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), the amount of organic carbon stored through the earth's soil, is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, exceeding the carbon in the atmospheric and biospheric pools multiple times (Bathjes). As such, even small changes in drivers of SOC may thus lead to substantial shifts in earth carbon cycle and influence the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere  (ref. permafrost melting). The specific amount of carbon stored in the soil is however uncertain, with estimates ranging from 1500 to 2400 GtC for the first meter of the soil profile (Bathjes, 1996). The quality of SOC maps has markedly improved in recent decades, along with better understanding of the factors driving the global magnitude, distribution, and dynamics of SOC pools. Natural properties like climatic, biophysical, and landscape characteristics clearly play the most important roles in this regard.  
Human intervention, including land cover change and land management, has however added a further driver to SOC change, which alters terrestrial carbon pools in much shorter time scales and is likely one of the most dominant driver of SOC changes on managed land today. Recent studies identify the anthropogenic SOC debt for the first meter of the soil profile at around 116 GtC (Sanderman et al.), compared to previous estimates between 60-130 GtC <!--look up --> (Lal, 2006). Other studies have focused more closely on spatially disaggregation of SOC changes via advanced digital soil mapping techniques (S-World; Stoorvogel 2, 2017) or better representation of biogeochemical processes within SOC dynamics  (Hararuk, 20XX). While providing a rough estimate of the order of magnitude of change, these studies lack a detailed consideration of land management, especial agricultural activities.  
Field-scale models (ref. Daycent, RothC, Ecosse, C-Tool) are able to capture these land mangement impacts by using detailed information on crop yield levels, fertilizer inputs and various other on-farm activities. However, due to the lack of comprehensive global management data as input to these models, scaling up to the global extent remains a complex challenge.  
Our study combines an spatially explicit estimate of agricultural management data on the global level with a 3-pool SOC model parametrized for global croplands. This allows us to estimate SOC stock change factors, as well as organic carbon flow dynamics within the agricultural system. We thereby consider change in SOC caused by historical land cover change as well as of different agricultural mangement practices, including residue recycling, manure amendments, irrigation, and tillage. We thereby provide the first global, spatially explicit SOC loss maps that consider detailed agricultural management.  
This paper will first introduce in the methods section the basic concept of SOC dynamics as applied in this study. We continue with a detailed description of the global gridded management data used here, including crop production levels, residue recycling rates, manure amendments, and the adoption of irrigation and tillage practices. Lastly, we shortly refer to the concept of stock change factors as outlined in the Tier 1 approach of the IPCC guidelines.  In our results section we focus on the SOC dynamics of global croplands by (1) analysing the spatially explicit distribution and depletion of SOC from 1975 to 2010, (2) comparing the climate zone specfic stock changes with default stock change factors from the IPCC Tier 1 approach and (3) quantify global agricultural carbon flows and stocks to compare the importance of various management aspects. Finally, we will discuss our findings -- including their implications for SOC model development -- and conclude with an outlook on the ability of SOC management to mitigate climate change and contribute to negative greenhouse gas emissions.
