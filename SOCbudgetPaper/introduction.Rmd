Within the last centuries the recognition of soil organic carbon (SOC) has developed from being a major source of agricultural carbon emissions towards a potentially large additional sink to offset other green house gas emissions and thus mitigate climate change. Whereas the extent of sink potential by SOC enhancement is highly debated (add refs), it is largely agreed upon that the SOC pool itself is the biggest terrestrial carbon pool, over topping the atmospheric and even more the biospheric carbon pool multiple times. Even small changes in SOC drivers might lead to substantial shifts in earth carbon cycled and influence the atmospheric CO2 concentration (ref. permafrost melting). The specific amount of carbon stored in the soil is uncertain though and estimates ranging from 1500 to 2400 GtC for the first meter of the soil profile (Bathjes, 1996). 

Mapping the worlds SOC has researches intensivly over the last decades and led to an increased quality of SOC maps as well as a even better understanding of factors driving magnitude, distribution and dynamics of SOC pools. It is undisputed that natural properties like climatic, biophysical and landscape characteristics play the most important role in this regard. Nevertheless,
these factors can not be easily altered by human intervention, leaving land cover, land use and land management changes the most important factors for SOC dynamics till dawn of civilization <!--to heroic find another word-->.

Recent studies identified the SOC debt of anthropogenic source at around 116 GtC (Sanderman et al.), which compares to older estimates of around 60-130 GtC <!--look up --> (Lal, 2006). Other studies have focus more closely on spatially disaggregation SOC changes via advanced digital soil mapping techniques (S-World; Stoorvogel 2, 2017) or better representation of biogeochemcial processes within SOC dynamics  (<!-- find microbial study -->). Most of these studies doing cutting edge research in their field, but seem to lack proper data on land management. 

On the other hand small-scale models (ref. Daycent, RothC, Ecosse, C-Tool) are able to represent well SOC dynamics on field-scale driven by detailed management data on yield levels, fertilizer inputs and various other on farming activities. Due to the lack of proper, concise management data to feed these input demanding models on larger extends, it seems still very complex to scale them up to a global extent.

This study however wants to contribute filling the gap on impacts of agricultural management like yield levels, residue recycling, manure amendments, irrigation and tillage on SOC stocks of the worlds croplands. It is doing so by combining work on agricultural management data on global level with a robust but light weighted SOC model to estimate SOC stocks and stock change factors as well as organic carbon flow dynamics within the agricultural system.

This is critically important since managing agricultural soil might be one of the few setscrew for humans to _naturally_ combat climate change (ref. to natural climate solutions). Other _natural_ options, which might be summarized by restoring potential natural stocks via renaturation of managed land, seem to be often limited due to increased pressure on the land systems for feed, food and energy demand of a growing and developing population on earth.

This paper will introduce in the the first part of the method section the basic concept of SOC dynamics. We continue in the second part with a detailed description of the used global gridded management data on production levels, residue recycling rates, manure amendments, irrigation and tillage adoption. In a third, small part, we shortly refer to the concept of stock change factors as outlined in the Tier 1 approach of the IPCC guidelines. 
In our result section we will focus on the SOC dynamics on global croplands by analysing (1) the spatial explicit SOC distribution and depletion over the last decades, (2) compare the climate zone specfic stock changes with default stock changes factors from the IPCC Tier 1 approach and (3) compare global agricultrual carbon flows and stocks to contextualize the importants of the different management aspects. 

Finally, we will discuss our findings and their implications on SOC model development and conlude with an analysis and outlook on the the opportunities for SOC management for climate change mitigation and negative emissions.
